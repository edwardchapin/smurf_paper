  The Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array 2 (\scuba) is an
  instrument operating on the 15-m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope,
  consisting of about 5000 bolometers in each of two simultaneous
  imaging bands centered over 450 and 850\,\micron. The camera is
  scanned across the sky and records data at a rate of 200\,Hz. This
  data volume is much greater than previously existing submillimetre
  cameras, and represents a significant data anlaysis challenge. We
  describe the production of SCUBA-2 maps using the Sub-Millimetre
  User Reduction Facility (SMURF) in which we have adopted a fast,
  iterative approach to map-making that enables data reduction on
  single, modern, high-end desktop computers with execution times that
  are shorter than the observing times.  SMURF is used in an automated
  setting both at the telescope for real-time feedback to observers,
  as well as for the production of generic science products at the
  Canadian Astronomical Data Centre. A suite of tools are also
  provided for interactive data analysis.  Three detailed case studies
  are used to: (i) explore convergence properties of the map-maker
  using simple prior constraints (Uranus -- a point source); (ii)
  achieve the white-noise limit of the instrument for faint
  point-source studies (blank-field survey of the Lockman Hole); and
  (iii) demonstrate that our strategy is capable of recovering angular
  scales up to the size of the array footprint (approximately
  5\,arcmin) for bright extended sources (star-forming region M17).

The Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array 2
\citep[\scuba,][]{2006SPIE.6275E..45H,holland2012} is a new instrument
for the 15-m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) on Mauna Kea,
Hawai'i. The camera simultaneously images the sky in two broad bands
centered over 450 and 850\,\micron, with approximately 7.5 and
14.5\,arcsec full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) point spread functions
(PSFs). The focal planes at each wavelength are populated with 4
rectangular subarrays, consisting of $40 \times 32$ bolometers each,
and together subtend a nearly 7\,arcmin $\times$ 7\,arcmin footprint
on the sky (excluding gaps, the continuous solid angle is about
43\,arcmin$^{2}$ per focal plane).  The instrument is also equipped
with a Fourier transform spectrometer \citep[FTS-2,][]{gom2010}, and a
polarimeter \cite[POL-2,][]{2011ASPC..449...68B}. This paper describes
the properties of \scuba\ data that are relevant to producing maps of
the imaging data, and the Submillimetre User Reduction Facility,
SMURF, a software package for perfoming the reduction written using
the Starlink Software Environment \citep{2009ASPC..411..418J}. The
analysis of FTS-2 and POL-2 data will be described at a later date
once these additional instruments have been commissioned and
characterized. The details of the instrument design, performance, and
its calibration are given in two companion papers: \citet{holland2012}
and \citet{dempsey2012}.

Over the last twenty years, observations in the submillimetre band
(defined here to be 200--1200\,\micron) have helped revolutionise
several important areas of astrophysics, including: the
characterisation of the early stages of star-formation by identifying the
dense, cold regions in molecular clouds where stars may eventually
form; discovering through blind surveys a class of massive dusty
star-forming galaxies in the early ($z>2$) Universe, now referred to
as submillimetre galaxies, or SMGs; and identifying debris disks
around nearby stars, helping us understand the early stages of planet formation.  With
$\sim10000$ total detectors, \scuba\ is presently the largest
submillimetre camera in the world, and the fastest wide-area
ground-based submillimetre imager.

Submillimetre imaging cameras generally use bolometers to maximise
sensitivity, in which an absorber collects photons that pass through
broad-band filters, and the signal is read out using a thermometer
\citep[e.g.][]{griffin2002}. The sensitivity of bolometers in a camera
like \scuba\ are limited by white photon and phonon noise from the
instrument and ambient backgrounds. The low-frequency noise, however,
is dominated by sources which produce slow variations in mean backgrounds
(e.g., thermal variations within the cryostat, and the atmosphere for
ground-based cameras), and drifts in the readout electronics. Such
noise has a power spectrum $\propto 1/f^\alpha$ ($\alpha>0$), and the
frequency at which it is comparable to the white noise level is called
the ``$1/f$ knee''. Since the low-frequency noise is largely
correlated between all, or subsets, of the bolometers in time, it can
be suppressed during map-making, since astronomical signals have the
distinct property that they are fixed in a sky reference frame
(assuming they are not time-varying). If successful, the noise in the
resulting map is said to be ``white noise limited'', meaning that the
map noise is uncorrelated spatially, and has an amplitude that scales
as the $\mathrm{NEFD}/\sqrt{t}$, where the NEFD is the
noise-equivalent flux-density (the white noise level of a bolometer in
1\,s of integration), and $t$ is the amount of integration time in a
map pixel.

There are numerous ways to attack this map-making problem, both in
terms of the data-collection method, and processing. The two most
important principles to follow in terms of scan strategy are: (i) to
modulate the astronomical signals of interest in such a way that they
appear in the lowest-noise regions of the bolometer noise power
spectrum, i.e., above the $1/f$ knee; and (ii) to provide good
``cross-linking'', in which each portion of the map is sampled on a
range of temporal scales, again, to help distinguish time-varying
noise features from fixed astronomical sources. In the case of \scuba,
(i) is achieved through fast-scanning of the entire telescope (up to
600\,arcsec\,sec$^{-1}$ slew speeds), such that significant drift in
the bolometers due to low-frequency noise occurs more slowly than the
crossing times for the astronomical scales of interest; and (ii) by
offering scan patterns that cross the sky at a wide range of position
angles, ultimately observing each portion of the map at a number of
different times. Such methods are now used by virtually all existing
ground-based submillimetre cameras
\citep[e.g.][]{glenn1998,weferling2002,wilson2008,kovacs2008b}., in
favour of ``chopping'' methods (where the secondary is quickly moved
to modulate the signal) that were more appropriate for older
instruments that had poorer low-frequency noise performance, and were
only sensivitve to modest angular scales

There are three general styles of map-making that are relevant to
reducing bolomter data in the literature. The simplest ``direct
methods'' involve some basic processing of the data to remove as much
noise contamination as possible, (e.g., using baseline removal and
other simple filters), and then re-gridding these cleaned data into a
map. Such was the basic recipe for the reduction of chopped data from
SCUBA-2's predecessor SCUBA
\citep{1998ASPC..145..216J,2000ASPC..216..559J}, and MAMBO, another
camera from the same generation. Generally speaking, such methods are
fast, although dependending on the science goals and noise properties
of the data, they may not achieve the best noise performance on the
angular scales of interest. A particular case of this method was
successfully used for the reduction of data from BOLOCAM
\citep[e.g.][]{laurent2005}, and its younger sibling AzTEC
\citep[e.g.][]{scott2008}, using ``principal component analysis''
(PCA) cleaning. A statistical black-box removes the most correlated
components of the bolometer signals, enabling the detection of
point-sources very close to the theoretical white-noise limits of the
detectors with reasonable computation times. However, PCA cleaning is
not a good generic solution for producing maps of extended structures,
since such sources produce correlated signals amongst many detectors,
and are removed by this procedure.

The best map-making strategies for recovering information on all
angular scales are \emph{maximum likelihood} techniques, in which the
time-series data are expressed as a sampling of the ``true'' map of
the sky plus noise, and then the equation is inverted to estimate the
map as some weighted linear combination of the data that minimizes the
variance.  The first good description of this method appears in
\citet{janssen1992} for the production of maps from the COsmic
Background Explorer (COBE -- the description is relevant despite the
fact that it used a differential radiometer instead of
bolometers). Other descriptions in the CMB literature include
\citet{tegmark1997} and \citet{stompor2002}, and an application to
data from SCUBA is described in \citet{borys2004}.  The downside to
such methods is that they can be both computationally expensive and
have large memory requirements. While for some experimental designs
fast iterative methods for the inversion do exist with minimal memory
usage \citep[e.g.][]{wright1996}, for the more general map-making
problem involving many detectors, the problem is significantly
complicated both by the need to measure the cross power-spectra for
all unique pairs of bolometers, and then to perform the inversion
itself. The most promising maximum-likelihood method that may one day
be applied to SCUBA-2 data is ``SANEPIC'', which successfully reduced
maps from the Balloon-borne Large-Aperture Submillimeter Telescope,
involving hundreds of bolometers, and correctly incorporating
inter-bolometer noise correlations \citep[][]{patanchon2008}.

%  Styles of map-making: least
%squares \citep{janssen1992} maximum likelihood
%\citep[e.g.,][]{patanchon2008}; iterative -- see \citet{johnstone2000}
%implementation of \citet{wright1996} to remove chop,
%\citet{kovacs2008} for SHARC-2 etc.; de-correlation using PCA analysis
%\citep[e.g.][]{laurent2005,scott2008,aguirre2010}.

The third approach adopted here for \scuba\ is a compromise between
the previous two methods. Under the assumption that a significant
portion of the (predominantly low-frequency) non-white noise sources
can be modeled, an iterative solution is obtained for both the
astronomical image and the parameters of the noise model. Since the
remaining (non-modelled) noise sources are assumed to be white, a
single scalar noise may be calculated for all of the data points from
a given bolometer (since the noise at any instant in time is
uncorrelated with others, nor with the data from other bolometers),
greatly simplifying the measurement of noise properties and the
inversion step that is so complicated in the maximum-likelihood
methods. In principle, it should also be possible to recover a wider
dynamic range in angular scales than the simplest ``direct'' methods,
with an increase in calculation time that is merely linear in the
number of iterations needed, while using a comparable amount of
memory. A fast iterative method for handling chopped data from CMB
experiments was described in \citet{wright1996}, and later applied to
chopped SCUBA data by \citet{johnstone2000}, although in each case the
chopping renders the data essentially white without the need to model
additional noise components. More similar to the algorithm described
here was the iterative method for fitting and removing baseline drifts
in SCUBA scan-map data as the astronomical image estimate improved
(...SURF reference?...). The two closest modern relatives of SMURF are the
Comprehensive Reduction Utility for SHARC-2
\citep[CRUSH,][]{kovacs2008}, and the pipeline developed for the
Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey \citep{aguirre2010}.

A reasonable model for correlated noise in \scuba\ is a single
``common-mode'' signal seen by all of the bolometers. Iterative
estimation and removal of this signal significantly lowers the $1/f$
knee, without compromosing structures on angular scales smaller than
the array footprint. Residual independent drifts at lower frequencies
are removed with an iterative high-pass filter. This strategy enables
SMURF to reduce data faster than they are taken, on single high-end
desktop computers, and it has successfully been used as part of a
real-time pipeline offering feedback to observers at the
telescope. The pipeline is also used to generate near-science grade
products using the JCMT Science Archive \citep{2011ASPC..442..203E}
hosted by the Canadian Astronomical Data Centre (CADC). Details of the
pipeline design are given in \citet{gibb2005} and
\citet{2008AN....329..295C}.

This paper is divided in the following way. We first describe the
properties of \scuba\ data and scan patterns in Section~\ref{sec:data}
to motivate the data model that we have adopted. Note that most of the
analysis described here applies equally to all of the data taken
to-date with \scuba, including during the Shared-Risks Observing
period (S2SRO) from 2010 February 11 to 2010 March 25 (during which
only single subarrays were available at each of the two observing
wavelengths). A comparison between the S2SRO and fully-commissioned
instrument is given in Section~\ref{sec:s2sro}. Next, the details of
the SMURF algorithm are given in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}. The
paper is concluded in Section~\ref{sec:examples} with three detailed
test cases that span the majority of observation types likely to be
undertaken with \scuba, with an emphasis on the mitigation of
divergence problems, and characterizing the output maps: (i) Uranus, a
bright, compact source (Section~\ref{sec:point}); (ii) the Lockman
Hole, a blind survey of faint point-like source
(Section~\ref{sec:cosmo}); and (iii) the star-forming region M17,
including bright, extended emission (Section~\ref{sec:extended}). All
of the data analyzed in this paper are publicly available through the
CADC SCUBA-2 raw-data queries page for the dates and observation
numbers given in the
text\footnote{\texttt{http://www3.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/
jcmt/search/scuba2}}. All of the analysis was performed using
\texttt{Starlink} version ... .


%\scuba\ is presently unique in terms of the shear volume of data that
%it produces on a nightly basis, and the fact that it is observing a
%wide variety of science targets for multiple users (unlike dedicated
%CMB experiments, for example). For this reason, SMURF has been
%designed to use a faster, and less memory-intensive algorithm than
%CMB-style maximum likelihood map-makers, although it is less accurate
%at reproducing large-scale structures. The basic procedure is to
%iteratively model and remove most of the bolometer-bolometer
%correlated signal components and independent low-frequency noise, and
%then regrid the residual signals.




% Historically, both radio
%and submillimetre telescope systems have used ``chopping'' to perform
%rapid differences between target sky locations and some reference
%(e.g., another point on the sky, internal calibrators, and different
%frequencies in the case of heterodyne systems). In fact, spatial
%chopping was used by SCUBA, the predecessor to \scuba, to remove
%low-frequency drifts \citep{holland1999}. However, chopping (in
%particular spatial chopping) has the unfortunate side-effect of
%filtering out information on scales larger than the chop-throw
%\textbf{(references)}.For this reason, modern cameras like \scuba\ aim
%to provide a high-degree of inherent detector stability, and rapidly
%slew the telescope so that astronomical signals up to large scales are
%captured in a signal band at considerably higher frequency than the
%residual low-frequency drift.

%In the case of chopped data, ideally the resulting data are completely
%free of low-frequency noise, and therefore the data samples are
%statistically uncorrelated.

%often used various
%``chopping'' methods to remove low-frequency drifts -- rapid
%differences are made between the sky signal at a given position and an
%internal reference signal; the sky signal in two different bands for
%heterodyne systems (frequency chopping); and a different position in
%the sky \citep[a method employed by SCUBA, the predecessor of
%\scuba][]{holland1999}.

\section{\scuba\ data properties}
\label{sec:data}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section we summarize how \scuba\ bolometers detect temperature
variations (Section~\ref{sec:bolos}), describe \scuba\ scan strategies
(Section~\ref{sec:scan}), typical bolometers signals
(Section~\ref{sec:bolosignal}), and the impact of magnetic field
pickup (Section~\ref{sec:magpickup}, describe the differences between
SCUBA-2 Shared Risk Observing data and those of the the fully
commissioned instrument (Section~\ref{sec:s2sro}), and finally
illustrate the use of principal component analysis
(Section~\ref{sec:pca}).

%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{How the \scuba\ bolometers work}
\label{sec:bolos}
%--------------------------------------------------

While the details of how \scuba\ works are described in
\citet{holland2012}, and its calibration in \citet{dempsey2012}, we
summarize the basic concepts relevant to map-making here.

The \scuba\ bolometer temperatures are read-out using superconducting
transition-edge sensors (TESs), with critical temperatures
$T_\mathrm{C}$ approximately 140 and 200\,mK at 850 and 450\,\micron,
respectively. The range about $T_\mathrm{C}$ in which the transition
from a superconductor to a normal material occurs is extremely small
(...typical value...?). The entire \scuba\ focal plane is held at a
\emph{base temperature} somewhat below $T_\mathrm{C}$. The TESs are
then biased up into the transition using two systems. First,
individual pixel heaters (using a current bias to apply the desired
Joule heating) are set to fixed values at the start of an observation
to compensate for most of the loading from the instrument and
atmosphere (in better weather, less compensation from the heaters is
required). Then, an electrical voltage bias is applied. As the
instrument observes, and there are tiny temperature fluctuations due
to astronomical sources and atmosphere, the impedence
changes. Thermoelectrical feedback helps to keep the TESs ``locked''
in the transition as this occurs; an increase in temperature increases
the impedence, and lowers the current and resulting heating
power. Changing magnetic fields resulting from these current changes
are then amplified using chains of superconducting quantum
interference devices (SQUIDs), and the larger output current is
finally digitized. Each detector has its own SQUID for the first-stage
of the amplification, but the remaining stages occur within a common
chain of SQUIDs for each of the 32 columns. All 40 rows are then
read-out in sequence at a row-visit frequency of about 12\,kHz. This
multiplexing scheme greatly reduces the number of readout and bias
lines to each detector, making such large-format bolometer array
designs feasible. Such a high sample rate is unnecessary to produce
maps, so the data are re-sampled to approximately 200\,Hz.  It should
also be noted that there is an additional 41st row of SQUID readouts
that are not connected to TES. These ``dark SQUIDs'' are used to track
non-thermal noise sources that are common to each column's amplifier
chain.

The response of the output digitized current, $I$, with respect to a
change in the power $P$ incident on the bolometer, $dI/dP$ depends on
the efficiency of the thermal absorber, how well the TES is biased
into the transition, and the gain of the SQUID amplifiers. In
practice, the response of a detector can therefore vary somewhat from
observation to observation depending on how the arrays have been
tuned, and the observing conditions \citep[see][]{holland2012}. To
track these changes, at the start of each observation, the current is
ramped through the bolometer heaters such that $dI/dP$ can be
measured. We will refer to the measurements of $dI/dP$ across the
focal plane as the \emph{flatfield} for a given observation.

In general, bolometers have two predominant noise components: (i) the
effectively white thermal noise produced by the phonon and optical
loading on the absorbers (largely independent from bolometer to
bolometer); and (ii) longer timescale drift resulting from slow
variations in the mean load (e.g. fridge, telescope, or atmospheric
changes), and also the readout electronics (often correlated amongst
many or all of the bolometers). As such, the spectrum corresponding to
a bolometer time-series exhibits a ``$1/f$'' shape below some knee
frequency, $f_\mathrm{knee}$, and is relatively flat at higher
frequencies. Other smaller effects may include line features in the
spectrum (common culprits are aliased high-frequency noise detected
during the multiplexed readout of the arrays as described in
Section~\ref{sec:bolos}, pickup from AC mains, or microphonic signals
induced by mechanical vibrations), and finally a roll-off towards the
Nyquist frequency caused by the anti-aliasing filter that precedes
digitisation.

The final conversion of power received by the detector into
astronomical flux units requires two more fundamental corrections: (i)
atmospheric extinction (due to atmospheric water vapour) must be
compensated for as a function of time; and (ii) the corrected power is
related to an astronomical flux density through the effective area of
the detector, the spectral response of the bolometers (with bandpasses
set by optical filters), the spectrum of the source, and the optical
efficiencies of the dish surface and other optical components in the
system -- a \emph{flux conversion factor} (FCF). Extinction is
measured, in most cases, using the JCMT line-of-sight water vapour
radiometer (WVM) which is calibrated using sky dips and the CSO
225\,GHz tipper. The FCF is determined empirically using measurements
of standard sources. For further details on these calibration steps,
see \citet{dempsey2012}.


%--------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Scan strategies}
\label{sec:scan}
%--------------------------------------------------

In order to observe astronomical sources, it is clearly advantageous
that the signals appear in the region of the spectrum that offers the
highest \snr, namely frequencies above $f_\mathrm{knee}$. This effect
is achieved by modulating the signal; the original SCUBA primarily
used the JCMT chopping secondary to place sources into the spectrum at
about $\sim$10\,Hz. The problem with this strategy was that SCUBA was
ultimately limited to recovering information on angular scales smaller
than the chop throw \citep[up to several arcmin,][]{holland1999}.  The
primary approach to map-making with \scuba\ is instead to slew the
entire telescope at such a rate that angular scales of interest are
crossed on time scales shorter than $1/f_\mathrm{knee}$, as with other
earlier ground-based instruments that did not use a chopping secondary
\citep[e.g.,][]{glenn1998,weferling2002,wilson2008,kovacs2008b}. The
desire to scan rapidly has two basic constraints: (i) while the
telescope can physically move up to about 1800 and
3600\,arcsec\,s$^{-1}$ in azimuth and elevation, respectively, the
acceleration limit is about 600\,arcsec\,s$^{-2}$ (in azimuth, larger
in elevation), meaning that significant time is waisted on
``turn-arounds'' at large scan speeds; and (ii) bolometers are
designed with a thermal time constant that balances response with
sensitivity. Taking these constraints into consideration, \scuba\ was
ultimately designed to operate at a maximum scan speed of
600\,arcsec\,sec$^{-1}$. The data acquisition system has a target
sample rate of 200\,Hz (although in practice it is typically in the
range 170--180\,Hz), which at that scan velocity results in a sample
every 3.0\,arcsec, or approximately one third of the 450\,\micron\
diffraction-limited full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) -- a typical
rule-of-thumb for adequately sampling a Gaussian point spread function
(PSF). Similarly, the \scuba\ bolometers are designed to have a time
constant of $\sim$1\,ms in order to avoid distorting PSF-sized sources
at this maximum scan rate.

The scan strategy is designed, primarily, to mitigate the effects of
$1/f$ drift. The simplest scan one might use is a raster
``boustrophedon'' pattern, i.e. a series of parallel passes across the
field. However, such a scan yields extremely poor performace for
structures that are transverse to the scan direction, since a long
time will have ellapsed between each parallel step, and the signal
will therefore be totally dominated by the $1/f$ noise. In addition,
other periodic noise features may appear in the data. With such a
regularly spaced scan strategy, these noise features can easily
conspire with the scan pattern to produce similarly periodic noise
structures in the map, or \emph{scan-synchronous} noise. It has
therefore been recognized that scan strategies that visit each region
of the map on as many different time scales, and scan angles as
possible offer the best protection against large-scale noise
\citep[see discussion in][and references therein]{kovacs2008b}; such
strategies are said to offer good \emph{cross-linking}. As a tradeoff
between truly random scan patterns and feasibility of implementation
taking into consideration both mechanical and scheduling constraints,
\scuba\ presently has three primary scan modes: PONG, which covers
rectangular areas larger than the array footprint in a closed pattern
that ``bounces'' off the edges at 45\,degree angles (and also usually
combined with a rotation through a number of fixed position angles to
create a ``rotating PONG'' with even better cross-linking); Lissajous,
in which sinusoidal functions describe the motion along orthogonal
axes (also to cover rectangular areas -- the PONG and Lissajous modes
are both related to similar scan modes developed at the Caltech
Submillimetre Observatory); and a ``constant velocity daisy'' for
small areas (of order the array footprint), in which the telescope
moves in a circle, whose centre also slowly traces out a circle. For a
more complete description of the \scuba\ observing modes, see
\citet{holland2012}.

\subsection{Differences between the S2SRO and 2011 fully-commissioned instrument}
\label{sec:s2sro}
%-------------------------------------------------

The S2SRO period took place during February and March 2010. For the
purpose of this paper, we will consider data taken as early as 2009
December 3, at which point the instrument was being commissioned in a
similar configuration to that of the S2SRO period. At this time, each
of the 450 and 850\,\micron\ focal planes were populated with single
subarrays, s4a and s8d respectively. There were three main problems to
contend with during this period. First, the fridge was not able to
cool the focal plane to the desired base temperature (partly due to
the heat conductance of the wires from the arrays during this period)
which affected stability, particularly at 850\,\micron. Second, a
non-sinusoidal, large-scale oscillation in the fridge temperature
could easily be seen as a common signal to all of the detectors with a
period of approximately 25\,s.  Third, there were problems with the
subarray fabrication process which led to large numbers of dead
pixels, as well as large-scale variations in $T_\mathrm{C}$ and the
thermal conductivity, $G$. These latter issues made it difficult to
simulataneously place all of the TESs into the optimal region of the
superconducting transition, leading to significantly poorer
sensitivities. While there were moderate variations from
night-to-night during the observing period, there were typically 600
to 900 working detectors in each of the s4a and s8d subarrays.

Since S2SRO the fridge performance has been greatly improved using NTD
thermometry to servo the temperature to a constant value, and with new
wiring, adequate base temperatures can now be achieved. However, the
gradient in detector properties across the focal plane continues to be
a problem now that there is a full complement of subarrays (which
still includes the two subarrays used during S2SRO). Optimal tuning to
achieve the greatest overall array sensitivity is described in
\citet{holland2012}.

  spread in the dotted lines at low frequencies compared to the

%-------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Typical bolometer signals}
\label{sec:bolosignal}
%-------------------------------------------------

In Fig.~\ref{fig:bolos_mix} we show sample time series from single
bolometers in each of the 450 and 850\,micron\ focal planes, as well
as variations in the mixing chamber temperature (as a proxy for the
focal-plane temperature), and the telescope pointing, for two data
sets, before and after the upgrades that followed S2SRO.

In the S2SRO data (left panel), observation 29 on 20100313, both
bolometers share significant long-timescale structure ($\gsim10$\,s)
that appears to be related to variations in the fridge base
temperature, although the similarity is clearly greater at
850\,\micron. In this particular case, the total power in the
fluctuations at 450\,\micron, from $-0.04$\,pW to $+0.08$\,pW, are
larger than the $-0.03$\,pW to $+0.05$\,pW fluctuations at
850\,\micron. Such behaviour might be expected if there is a
comparable varying thermal load from the fridge at each wavelength,
but a larger contribution of atmospheric variations through the
450\,\micron\ bandpass filters. We also note that there is no obvious
strong correlation between the low-frequency signal structure, at
either wavelength, with the telescope motion.

The low-frequency signal component of the S2SRO bolometer output is
also highly correlated amongst bolometers in the same subarray. We
have calculated a common-mode signal, $\mathbf{c}(t)$, as the average
time series of all the working bolometers. We then fit the amplitude
of $\mathbf{c}(t)$ at each wavelength to the signals shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:bolos_mix} and remove it, yielding the grey residual
signals. These residuals are quite flat, although still with
noticeable variations. The white noise is also apparent, and larger at
450\,\micron\ as one would expect from the larger backgrounds compared
to 850\,\micron.

Data from the fully commissioned instrument, observation 38 on
20111112, are shown in the right panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:bolos_mix}. Having solved the fridge oscillation
problem, these data no longer exhibit a correlation with the mixing
chamber (note that variations are still seen in the mixing chamber; it
is likely that these are not observed at the focal plane itself, where
the NTD thermometry used in the servo loop is performed). There is
minimal correlated low-frequency noise in these 450\,\micron\ data
(note that there is almost no difference once the common-mode has been
subtarcted). The 850\,\micron\ channel, however, exhibits a
significant signal that is obviously correlated with the telescope
motion. This signal is correlated amongs many of the detectors, and
common-mode removal yields fairly flat residuals. Part of the reason
that this is seen here, and not in the S2SRO data set shown, is that
the amplitude of the scan pattern is somewhat larger. Most of this
``scan-synchronous'' noise is attributed to magnetic field pickup, as
described in Section~\ref{sec:magpickup}.

Next, we produce power spectral density (PSD) plots for several
representative bolometers from both focal planes, using the same two
data sets, in Fig.~\ref{fig:pspec}. To produce this figure, we follow
the convention that the PSD as a function of frequency,
$\mathbf{P}(f)$, is normalized such that the integral over frequency
gives the same variance as the time-series variance across the full
time series. In other words, given a bolometer signal $\mathbf{b}(t)$,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:psd}
\langle\mathbf{b}^2(t)\rangle = 2 \int_0^{f_\mathrm{N}} \mathbf{P}(f)
df ,
\end{equation}
%
where we only integrate over the positive frequencies up to
$f_\mathrm{N}$, the Nyquist frequency, and the factor of 2 accounts
for the (equal) power that appears at negative frequencies in the
discrete Fourier Transform. The units of the PSD written in this form
are pW$^2$\,Hz$^{-1}$; without the factor of 2 in front the convention
would be to write the units as pW$^2$\,s to distinguish the two
normalisations.

The dotted coloured lines in Fig~\ref{fig:pspec} show the PSDs for
raw, though flat-fielded data. At each wavelength, and in both data
sets, there are clear $1/f$ knees at frequencies ranging from roughly
1 to 10\,Hz, followed by a predominantly white spectrum punctuated by
line features at higher frequencies, and finally a roll-off caused by
the anti-aliasing filter above $\gsim 70$\,Hz. As indicated in the
previous section, the correlation between the low-frequency components
of the different bolometer signals is large. The solid black lines in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pspec} indicate the PSDs of the common-modes
$\mathbf{c}(t)$ at each wavelength, which reproduce much of the
low-frequency structure, as well as some of the higher-frequency line
features. The $\mathbf{c}(t)$ otherwise drop substantially below the
individual bolometer PSDs at high-frequency, as expected if the
bolometers are dominated by un-correlated white noise. The common-mode
signals are fit to each bolometer time series and removed as in
Fig.~\ref{fig:bolos_mix}, and the resulting PSDs are shown as solid
coloured lines.  For reference, the top horizontal axes have been
converted to angular scale assuming the scan speeds of each
observation (120\,arcsec\,s$^{-1}$ in the left-hand plot, and
190\,arcsec\,s$^{-1}$ in the right-hand plot). The power spectra of
unresolved point-sources are also shown as dashed lines in each band
(arbitrarily normalized), showing that the smallest features
resolvable by the telescope are only minimally affected by the excess
noise in the line features.

In the S2SRO data (left-hand panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:pspec}), the
low-frequency noise is very correlated between the detectors (note the
tight scatter in the dotted colour lines, and their resemblance to the
common-mode), due to it being dominated by the fridge
oscillations. Common-mode subtraction is very effective, reducing the
$1/f$ knees in both wavelengths by about a factor of 5.

Raw data from the fully-commissioned instrument (right-hand panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:pspec}) generally have noticeably lower $1/f$ knees
(with the exception of some of the noisier 850\,\micron\ bolometers in
this example) as compared with the S2SRO data. The residual
low-frequency noise is considerably less correlated amongst detectors
(larger spread in the dotted colour lines), leading to a less drastic
improvement upon common-mode removal. However, since the data are less
dominated by low-frequency noise to begin with, the signals generally
require less low-frequency filtering to produce maps, and therefore
retain larger-scale structures than with the S2SRO data. Furthermore,
there are generally fewer line features in the PSDs of bolometers in
the fully-commissioned instrument. Finally, these two data sets
illustrate how the white noise performance (NEFD) can vary. For this
particular data set, the 850\,\micron\ noise performance is
substantially worse than in the example from the S2SRO
period. Generally speaking such noise steps occur in only a subset of
the \scuba\ subarrays. However, given the 4-fold increase in available
working bolometers since S2SRO, and the improved low-frequency noise
performance, \scuba\ is now a significantly faster mapping instrument,
and preserves information up to larger angular scales.

%-------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Magnetic field pickup}
\label{sec:magpickup}
%-------------------------------------------------

An additional noise source that appears to be significant in only a
small subset of the data (and moreso during the S2SRO period) is
magnetic field pickup. Since the bolometer signals are ultimately
detected through the amplification of magnetic fields, any additional
changing fields within the cryostat will also be detected.

An example of an observation where pickup appears to be significant is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:magpickup}. The time-series for two
450\,\micron\ bolometers in the same column (not flatfielded) show
that there is a strong signal with a similar shape, but opposite
signs. This behaviour is seen across the entire array. The dark squid
signal for the same columns exhibits a similar shape and
amplitude. Since the dark squid has no thermal absorber or TES
attached to it, this observed signal is not likely to be optical or
thermal in nature (although there can be some cross-talk with the
bolometers). It is also for this reason that the higher-frequency
noise that appears in the bolometer data (thermal) does not appear in
the dark squid, leading to a significantly higher \snr. Due to the
fact that the sign of the gain in each stage of SQUID amplification is
random (although the combined gain is constrained to be negative), and
since magnetic field pickup is only seen at the input to the second
stage, the pickup can appear with random signs for bolometers along a
a column, giving it a distinct signature from other common signals
that appear with the same sign.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{magpickup.pdf}
\caption{Evidence for significant magnetic field pickup for
  observation 20100228\_00016.  The top panel shows two un-flatfielded
  (but mean-subtracted) bolometer time-series from the same column,
  with a 200 sample boxcar smooth (approximately 1\,s), illustrating
  that they are dominated by a similar signal with opposite signs. The
  second panel shows the dark squid signal for the column, also
  mean-subtracted and with the same boxcar smooth. The bottom panel
  shows the azimuthal and elevation offsets from the map centre. For
  reference, the mean azimuth was 171.9$^\circ$ and the mean elevation
  68.0$^\circ$. Only the azimuthal signal appears to be correlated
  with the dark squids and bolometer signals, which suggests a
  magnetic field stationary with respect to the telescope dome as the
  source, since its direction with respect to the cryostat only
  changes with azimuthal motion.}
\label{fig:magpickup}
\end{figure}

The telescope pointing offsets for this approximately 0.5\,degree
diameter scan are also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:magpickup}. Since the
phase of the azimuth offsets from the map centre in this scan pattern
slowly drifts with respect to the elevation offsets, it is clear that
the bolometer and dark squid signals are detecting a noise source that
is correlated only with the azimuthal motion and \emph{not} the
elevation. This behaviour would be expected if if there were a strong
magnetic field fixed with respect to the telescope dome (i.e., the
earth's magnetic field). Since \scuba\ is mounted on a Nasmyth
platform, only azimuthal motion will change the effective direction of
such a field with respect to the cryostat. Tests have shown that, as
in this example, large scans in azimuth generically produce pickup. In
contrast, and as expected, changes in elevation results in pickup that
is approximately three orders-of-magnitude smaller.

%-------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Principal component analysis}
\label{sec:pca}
%-------------------------------------------------

A method that has been employed by teams analyzing BOLOCAM and AzTEC
data to identify and remove correlated noise is Principal Component
Analysis \citep[PCA,][]{laurent2005,scott2008}. We initially used PCA
to gain further insight into the nature of the \scuba\ noise
properties, but it is now also included in SMURF as method for
cleaning the data.

The basic method is as follows: (i) a covariance matrix is built up
for all pairs $(i,j)$ of the $N$ bolometer time series,
$\langle\mathbf{b}_i(t),\mathbf{b}_j(t)\rangle$; and (ii) a singular
value decomposition is used to identify a new set of statistically
uncorrelated eigenvectors, $\mathbf{\xi}_i(t)$ (i.e. whose covariance
matrix is diagonal), such that each of the bolometer time series is a
linear combination of the eigenvectors, or \emph{components}
i.e. $\mathbf{b}_i(t) = \bar{\mathbf{\xi}}
\mathbf{\lambda}_i^\mathrm{T}$, where each row of the matrix
$\bar{\mathbf{\xi}}$ is an eigenvector, and
$\mathbf{\lambda}_i^\mathrm{T}$ is a column vector containing the
corresponding eigenvalues. The $\mathbf{\xi}_i$ are normalized by
their \rms, so that the amplitude of each component is stored in the
eigenvalues. In the earlier analyses mentioned, the low-frequency
noise is assumed to be encapsulated in those components with the
largest eigenvalues. Removing the projection of the time series along
those components has been used successfully to reduce $1/f$ noise
while retaining most of the signal in point-like sources. It is also
worth noting that there is an implicit assumption in this analysis
that the noise properties are stationary.

One unique feature of the \scuba\ data is that one can perform a PCA
analysis of both the 450 and 850\,\micron\ data simultaneously. The
first 6 most significant modes of our analysis are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pca}, with the eigenvectors in the top panels, and maps
of the eigenvalues in each subarray in the bottom panels.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pca.pdf}
\caption{The first six modes from a principal component analysis,
  ordered by decreasing significance, of the combined 450 and
  850\,\micron\ time-series bolometer data. For each component, the
  top plot shows the time series of the eigenvector, normalized by its
  \rms. The bottom coloured panels show the eigenvalues for the
  bolometers at each wavelength (the amplitude of the eigenvector in
  the time series). For reference, both the mean, $\bar{\lambda}$, and
  \rms, $\lambda_\mathrm{rms}$, eigenvalues for the bolometers in each
  subarray are also shown. The first two components have comparable
  amplitudes, and dominate by at least a factor of 10 any other
  components of the time series. We suspect that they are caused by
  atmospheric variations (expected to be brighter at 450\,\micron),
  and fridge oscillations (expected to be comparable at each
  wavelength). However, the two eigenvectors do not necessarily map
  directly to these physical sources under this interpretation; rather
  they are two \emph{different} linear combinations of the underlying
  physical signals that give rise to statistically uncorrelated
  components. The third component accurately reproduces an apparent
  data-acquisition glitch that appears only at 450\,\micron. The
  fourth component is a periodic feature only observed in column 15 of
  the 450\,\micron\ subarray. The fifth component shows a series of
  steps and glitches that appear predominantly along the bottom-left
  edge of the 850\,\micron\ subarray where the bolometers are poorly
  biased. Finally, the sixth component is degenerating into a less
  significant, and more randomly scattered signal across the focal
  plane. Subsequent components follow this trend, and would generally
  be kept in a PCA-cleaning procedure.}
\label{fig:pca}
\end{figure*}

The majority of correlated signal at both wavelengths is clearly
broken down into the first two components plotted. The first dominates
at 450\,\micron, whereas the second dominates at 850\,\micron. For
reference, the eigenvalues of these two modes are in the range
$\sim1$--4\,pW, whereas the remaining modes have eigenvalues
$\lsim0.3$\,pW. As mentioned earlier, one simple model for the
correlated signal is a simple combination of oscillations in base
temperature (which would be similar in each band), with a varying
atmospheric signal (which is expected to be stronger at
450\,\micron). Indeed, the fainter Component 2 most closely resembles
the mixing chamber temperature variations (Fig.~\ref{fig:bolos_mix}),
whereas Component 1 is stronger at 450\,\micron\ and does not resemble
the fridge signal as closely.

This physical interpretation of the eigenvectors should, however, be
taken with a grain of salt, since the PCA analysis is really a
statistical black box. Suppose most of the low frequency noise really
could be decomposed into two components, the fridge signal
$\mathbf{F}(t)$, and an atmospheric signal $\mathbf{A}(t)$. The two
eigenvectors obtained from the PCA analysis are simply linear
combinations of $\mathbf{F}(t)$ and $\mathbf{A}(t)$ that are
statistically uncorrelated. Depending on the particular realisations
of these two noise sources, this decomposition may, or may not give
rise to eigenvectors that resemble the two underlying physical
sources. Regardless, similar analyses of a few data sets during S2SRO
give comparable results; most of the signal at both 450\,\micron\ and
850\,\micron\ appears to be produced by two dominant underlying
mechanisms, even if we cannot identify the mechanisms with any
confidence.

The subsequent components identified by the PCA analysis in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pca} vary wildly. Component 3, though not obvious from
its eigenvector plot, is almost a pure ramping waveform that only
appears in the s4a data, and produces the broad line featuress centred
over 45\,Hz and 70\,Hz in the 450\,\micron\ PSDs in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pspec}. In other data sets, this third component has
also often instead exhibited a regularly-spaced series of spikes with
heights quantized into several amplitude families (again, only in the
s4a array). In both cases, the shape and phase of this signal is the
same in each bolometer, although the amplitude (and sign) varies, as
evidenced by the large random scatter in the s4a eigenvalue maps. It
is thought that these features are some sort of aliased high-frequency
data acquisition glitch, as the spikes (when they appear) exhibit the
expected point response function of the anti-aliasing
filter. Similarly, Component 4 also appears to be a data acquisition
glitch in the s4a array, although along a single column, and with a
peak at a lower frequency of 40\,Hz, together with a second feature
right at the Nyquist frequency.

The last two components in Fig.~\ref{fig:pca} have an entirely
different character. The amplitudes of both components are greatest in
low-responsivity regions of the two subarrays (lower-right at
450\,\micron\ and bottom-left at 850\,\micron). Bolometers in these
regions of the subarray are probably not optimally biased, and are
more sensitive to changes in the loading, possibly resulting in the
step and spikes that are seen in Component 5. Component 6 is clearly
related to Component 5, though with the absence of the steps and
spikes, so that together they seem to represent a continuum of shapes
that are linear combinations of the spikes and steps, with the slower
drift evident only in Component 6.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The SMURF Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given \scuba's data rate, SMURF was designed with two primary goals in
mind: (i) reduced maps should be scientifically useful and of ``near
publication quality'' with minimal user interaction; and (ii) the
execution time should not appreciably exceed the amount of time
required to conduct observations on a high-end multi-tcore desktop
computer. By attaining these goals it would be possible to conduct
real-time reductions at the telescope to offer feedback to observers,
and it would also be possible to maintain a central repository of
(nearly) publishable data products.

As described in the introduction, rather than pursue a slow but
potentially more accurate \emph{maximum likelihood} method that would
require the inversion of a complex linear problem, we instead use an
iterative approach that estimates and removes most of the correlated
(and in particular low-frequency) noise sources in parallel with a
simplified map estimation. We do note, however, that recent advances
in direct inversion methods such as SANEPIC \citep{patanchon2008} may
in fact be tenable for \scuba\ data. A future goal of the software
team is to investigate meshing SMURF (perhaps as a cleaning step and
initial condition) for a SANEPIC-like algorithm.

The remainder of this section gives an overview of the model that is
assumed by SMURF for the \scuba\ data, and the typical steps used to
estimate a map. Subsequent sections discuss problems with this model
and additional processing steps and constraints that can be used to
improve the solution in different cases.

\begin{itemize}

\item Describe the bolometer signal model, and with the help of a flow-chart
show the basic procedure that SMURF follows.

\item Discuss SMURF configurability

\item Some sort of proof/demonstration showing why the algorithm works

\item Discuss performance (execution time, memory, disk usage etc.)

\item Where do you get SMURF/starlink, usage of NDF

\item Talk about pipeline?

\end{itemize}

We express the signal observed by the $i$th bolometer as a function of
 time, \textbf{Per: $e_i(t)$ is written as a vector ( bold ) but I assume
 we use it as a scalar.}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{b}_i(t) = g_i[\mathbf{e}_i(t) \mathbf{a}_i(t) + \mathbf{n}_i(t)],
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{a}(t)$ is the time-varying signal produced by scanning
the telescope across astronomical sources, $\mathbf{e}(t)$ is the
time-varying extinction, which is a function of the telescope
elevation and atmospheric conditions, and $\mathbf{n}_i(t)$ represents
sources of noise. The two terms in square brackets, as written, have
units of power delivered to the detectors (pW). The scale factor $g_i$
converts this effective power to the digitized units recorded on disk
(DAC) -- the \emph{flatfield} multiplied by a digitization constant --
and in this formulation it is assumed to be constant in time.

We then express the noise, $\mathbf{n}_i(t)$, as the sum of several
components,
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{n}_i(t) = \mathbf{n}^\mathrm{w}_i(t) + \mathbf{n}^\mathrm{f}_i(t) +
  \mathbf{n}^\mathrm{c}(t),
\label{eq:noise}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{n}^\mathrm{w}_i(t)$ is uncorrelated white (thermal)
noise, $\mathbf{n}^\mathrm{f}_i(t)$ is low-frequency noise that is
\emph{not} correlated from bolometer-to-bolometer, and
$\mathbf{n}^\mathrm{c}(t)$ is a (predominantly low-frequency)
correlated or \emph{common-mode} component. The primary goal of
map-making is to model and remove $\mathbf{n}^\mathrm{f}_i$ and
$\mathbf{n}^\mathrm{c}$ from the time-series, and then by re-gridding
the remaining data we can hope to approach the theoretical noise limit
in the map. This procedure is summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:dimm}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{dimm.pdf}
\caption{Typical map-making algorithm. Raw data (stored in multiple
  files) are read and concatenated into continuous time series. A
  pre-processing stage repairs DC steps, applies a flatfield
  correction, and identifies and removes the noisiest bolometers. The
  iterative portion then begins: estimating and removing the
  common-mode signal; applying the extinction correction; high-pass
  filtering to remove residual independent low-frequency noise;
  estimating the map by re-gridding the data; and finally measuring
  the noise in the residual time series. If the \rms\ has converged,
  the final map is written to disk. Otherwise any multiplicative
  factors that may have been applied to the data are inverted (e.g.,
  extinction correction and relative gains measured during the
  common-mode calculation), and each additive component is added back
  into the time series and re-estimated in turn.  {\bf Per: The data
  flow is not clear to me. One way would be to take the ast map and
  remove extinction and gain correction and subtract it from the raw
  data and then simply start the iteration again. That would refine
  the com model from ast model pollution. But the text suggest that
  the other models also are removed from the data. Indeed this would
  be way different models can interact diverge. This process how and
  when this is done is not clear and there must be a number of
  subtleties affecting the subtraction of the models.}}
\label{fig:dimm}
\end{figure}

First, the data files are read from disk, concatenated into contiguous
arrays in memory, and run through a pre-processing stage that performs
several operations including spike and sudden level step removal to
enforce continuity in the time-series. Then, the iterative process
within the dashed box begins. It is generally assumed that the
dominant noise component is the common-mode, which is presumably
dominated by large variations in the fridge temperature and sky noise
(as argued in Section~\ref{sec:pca}). This signal is estimated as the
average signal observed by all of the bolometers at each time step,
and then removed from all of the bolometers. Once this large signal
has been removed, we apply the extinction correction, which is
determined completely from external measurements
\citep[see][]{dempsey2012}. Next, residual noise that differs from
bolometer-to-bolometer (primarily low-frequency) is removed, usually
using a high-pass filter. The resulting ``clean'' time-series are then
re-gridded to produce a map estimate using nearest-neighbour
sampling. Since each map pixel is calculated as the average of many
bolometer samples, it is fundamentally much less noisy than the raw
bolometer time-series. We can therefore project the map back into the
time domain (i.e. scanning the array across the current estimate of
the map), and create approximately noiseless estimates of what each
bolometer would have seen in the absence of noise sources, and remove
that from the time-series. This final step in the iteration gives a
residual signal (with low-frequency and astronomical noise components
removed) that may be used to measured the white noise level in each
detector, and also to estimate an approximate $\chi^2$ for the model
to track convergence. As we will discuss in the next sections, each
signal component estimate is biased slightly due to the presence of
signal from other components, so the entire process is
iterated. However, before the next iteration begins, we first undo the
multiplicative factors introduced by the extinction correction, and
also relative gains that may optionally be determined in the
common-mode estimation phase.

In practice, the map-maker is highly configurable, both in terms of
the order in which model components are fit (and whether they are fit
at all), and the details of \emph{how} they are fit. A summary of the
model components is given in the next section.

%-------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Model components}
\label{sec:components}
%-------------------------------------------------

In addition to specifying when each model component is computed
(normally an attempt is made to order them by decreasing amplitude in
the time-series), there are a number of parameters that control their
operation. Table~\ref{tab:components} lists the model components and
the typical order in which they are calculated. The following sections
describe their implementation in detail.

\subsubsection{\model{COM,GAI}: common-mode estimation}
\label{sec:comgai}

﻿Fig.~\ref{fig:com} shows the time series from a selection of typical
bolometers.\footnote{The data have been flat-fielded and each time
series has been adjusted to a mean value of zero.} The similarity
between most bolometers is evident, and forms the common-mode signal
-- assumed to be a consequence of variations in the atmospheric
emission and fridge temperature. This common-mode usually dominates
the astronomical signal for all but the brightest sources, and swamps
faint extended structure.  The purpose of the \model{COM} and
\model{GAI} models is to remove this common-mode signal.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{com.pdf}
\caption{A selection of typical bolometer time series after
flatfielding and removal of a constant baseline. It can be seen that
most bolometers exhibit a common time variation overlayed with other
features. Empty squares indicate the locations of dead bolometers.}
\label{fig:com}
\end{figure}

The \model{COM} model is the common-mode signal itself. It is a single
time series that is estimated by finding the mean of all bolometers at
each time step. Bolometer values that have been flagged as unusable
for any reason are excluded from the mean. {\bf Per: has a comment in
here about stability of the gain pattern... it should be constant
right?}.

Since bolometers have varying sensitivities, the amplitude of the
common-mode variations will also vary from bolometer to bolometer. So
comparing each bolometer time stream with the common-mode signal
allows an estimate of the bolometer sensitivity to be obtained. In
practice, a least squares linear fit is performed between the
bolometer time series and the common-mode to determine a gain and
offset for each bolometer.  The gain and offset for each bolometer is
known as the \model{GAI} model. Each bolometer value can then
optionally be scaled and shifted using these values so that all
bolometers share a common (but as yet unknown) calibration. This
provides an alternative (or additional) flat-fielding strategy to that
described in section~\ref{sec:bolos}.

An option exists to cater for time-varying sensitivities. If used, the
least squares fits described above are performed on short blocks of
contiguous time slices, providing multiple gain and offset values for
each bolometer (one pair for each block of time slices). The gain and
offset at any required time slice can then be found by interpolation
between these values.

It can be seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:com} that some bolometers depart
radically from the common-mode, indicating some problem within the
bolometer. Such bolometers are identified by calculating the Pearson
coefficient of correlation between each bolometer time-stream and the
common mode. Bolometers for which the correlation coefficient is below
a specified limit, or which have a negative gain, are flagged as bad
in order to omit them from the final map. If the option described
above for handling time-varying sensitivities is used, then a
correlation coefficient can be determined for each individual block of
time slices.  This allows individual bad blocks to be rejected from a
bolometer time stream, rather than rejecting the whole bolometer. This
is beneficial for bolometers that follow the common-mode for most of
the time but suffer from transient problems at specific times. {\bf
Per: If magnetic pickup dominates the common mode a negative gain is
normal and should not be removed. This might be a risk at high
elevation in very good stable weather!}

The common-mode is calculated from all bolometers that have not
previously been flagged as bad. Thus, aberrant bolometers with low
correlation coefficients will be included, polluting the common-mode. For
this reason, an iterative approach is taken to estimating the common-mode.
The initial common-mode estimate is formed from all remaining bolometers.
Aberrant bolometers with low correlation coefficients are then identified
by comparing each bolometer time stream with the common-mode. Such
aberrant bolometers are flagged as bad, and a new estimate of the
common-mode is produced omitting the newly flagged bolometers. This
process is repeated until no further bolometers are rejected.

Any astronomical sources that are smaller than the array size will
contribute signal to some bolometers but not other bolometers, thus
biassing the simple mean used to estimate the common mode. However, on
each iteration of the map-making algorithm illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dimm}, a large fraction of the remaining astronomical
signal is extracted from the bolometer time series and transferred to the
output map, resulting in subsequent estimates of the common-mode being
more accurate.

Any extended astronomical emission on a scale comparable to or larger
than the spatial extent of the area used to estimate the common-mode will
contribute a similar signal to all bolometers. Therefore such extended
emission is indistinguishable from the other sources of common-mode
signal (fridge and atmosphere variations) and will be removed by the
model. This places a limit on the spatial extent of astronomical
structure that can be recovered.

For this reason, the usual practice is to estimate a single
\model{COM} model by examining data from all four sub-arrays in each
waveband, since this allows spatial structure on the scale of the
whole focal plane to be recovered. However, sometimes there is
evidence that the common-mode differs from one array to another, and
so an option exists to estimate a separate \model{COM} model for each
individual subarray, with a consequent lowering in the scale of
spatial structure that can be recovered.

\subsubsection{\model{EXT}: extinction correction}
\label{sec:ext}

The extinction correction is a multiplicative factor that is normally
derived using the JCMT water vapour radiometer (WVM), and is not
considered to be a free parameter in the solution. However, it is
applied as part of the iterative solution, rather than a
pre-processing step, since any small errors will be amplified by the
large low-frequency drifts in the raw bolometer time-series. For
example, if the bolometer drift is 1000 times greater than an
astronomical source of interest, a 1 per cent error in the flatfield
will produce stripes of order 10 times the astronomical signal
amplitude in the final map! If \model{EXT} is applied after the bulk
of the low-frequency noise has been removed (e.g., \model{COM,GAI}),
then there is little potential for such small errors to affect the
final map.  For details on how it is calculated see
\citet{dempsey2012}. Note that its numerical value is calculated only
once, and simply applied as a scale factor in the iterative solution.

\subsubsection{\model{FLT}: fourier transform filter}
\label{sec:flt}

This model takes the FFT of the bolometer time-stream data, and can
apply both high- and low-pass filters, as well as notch filteres, at
hard frequency edges specified by the user. Alternatively, the
frequency edges of the filters may be defined in terms of an
\emph{angular scale}, but converted into a frequency through knowledge
of the mean telescope slew speed. The time-series may optionally have
apodization applied before the transform to avoid ringing (primarily
caused by wrap-around discontinuities at the ends of the
time-series). Finally, a whitening filter may also be applied in which
a simple $1/f^\alpha + \mathrm{constant}$ is fit to the power spectrum
of each bolometer, and then the bolometer FFT is multiplied by its
inverse (though normalized to preserve the white noise level).  The
signals that are \emph{removed} from the time-series by this process
are stored in the \model{FLT} container array. Typically this model is
used purely as a high-pass filter to remove most of the residual $1/f$
noise following common-mode removal. Low-pass filtering is redundant
for two reasons: (i) SMURF already low-pass filters and re-samples to
a lower sample rate, as described in Section~\ref{sec:downsamp}; and
(ii) the act of re-gridding the data to produce map estimates
effectively low-pass filters the data at a frequency that corresponds
to the inverse of the crossing time of a single map pixel. Notch
filters have not been proven to be useful with \scuba\ data,
particularly since line features tend to move around (i.e. a dynamic
line-detection system would have to be developed, and care would have
to be taken that astronomical sources are not suppressed).

\subsubsection{\model{AST}: map estimation}
\label{sec:ast}

Map estimation is accomplished using a nearest-neighbour resampling of
the data onto a pre-defined map grid. For the $i$th map pixel
$\mathbf{m}(x_i,y_i)$, the brightness is estimated as the weighted
average of the bolometer data samples $\mathbf{b}_j$ that land within
that pixel (from any bolometer or point in time),
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{m}(x_i,y_i) = \frac{\sum_j \mathbf{w}_j \mathbf{b}_j }
                             { \sum_j \mathbf{w}_j } .
\end{equation}
%
For the initial iteration the weights $\mathbf{w}_j$ are set to 1, but
subsequently they are set to $1/\sigma_j^2$, the estimated inverse
variance expected from the bolometer white noise levels, as discussed
in Section~\ref{sec:noi}. This weighting scheme is sensible provided
that the bolometer data have no correlated (i.e., low-frequency)
noise.

In addition to the signal map, a variance map $\mathbf{v}(x_j,y_j)$ is
estimated. The default behaviour is to estimate this weighted error on
the mean given the scatter in the weighted samples. This is
accomplished by dividing the \emph{biased weighted sample variance} by
the number of samples that went into the average (akin to the formula
for standard error on the mean, but accounting for weights),
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:varmap}
\mathbf{v}(x_j,y_j) = \frac{\sum_j \mathbf{w}_j
                            \sum_j \mathbf{w}_j \mathbf{b}_j -
                            \left( \sum_j \mathbf{w}_j \mathbf{b}_j \right)^2 }
                           { N \left( \sum_j \mathbf{w}_j \right)^2 },
\end{equation}
%
where $N_j$ is the total number of bolometer samples that land in the
pixel. As written, this algorithm is numerically unstable if the two
terms in the numerator are large, and of nearly the same value:
floating point precision errors can cause the difference to be
significantly incorrect. In practice we use the more numerically
stable ``weighted incremental algorithm'' that calculates incremental
differences, as described in \citet{west1979}.

 We decided not to use an \emph{unbiased} estimator (e.g., the
extension of the common $(1/N-1)\sum_j (\mathbf{b}_j -
\bar{\mathbf{b}})^2$ estimator using weights), since in practice it
would require accumulating an additional array of values at every map
pixel, and only results in a small difference where there are less
than $\sim10$ samples per pixel (a situation that is almost never
encountered in a \scuba\ map except in the edge pixels).

Finally, once the map estimation is complete, the map is projected
into the time domain (the signal that would be produced in each
bolometer by the signal represented by the map) and removed.

In addition to map estimation, the \model{AST} model can also be used
to perform map-based despiking of the time-series
(Section~\ref{sec:mapdespike}), and to apply constraints to the map to
improve convergence (Section~\ref{sec:converge}).

\subsubsection{\model{NOI}: noise estimation}
\label{sec:noi}

The primary purpose of the noise component, \model{NOI}, is to measure
the white noise of each bolometer ($\mathbf{n}^\mathrm{w}_i(t)$ in
Eq.~\ref{eq:noise}). The measurement generally occurs once all of the
other models have been fit and removed. This noise may then be used to
estimate weights for the data in subsequent iterations.

First, the bolometer PSDs are calculated as in Eq.~\ref{eq:psd}. An
average white noise level is then measured from 2 to 10\,Hz, a
relatively clean region of the PSD that tends to lie above the $1/f$
knee, but below the high-frequency line features for typical bolometer
data (Fig.~\ref{fig:pspec}). Taking this constant level for
$\mathbf{P}(f)$ we then calculate the expected variance of the
time-series (in approximately 200\,Hz samples) using
Eq.~\ref{eq:psd}. If the bolometer noise were produced purely by
uncorrelated thermal sources (i.e. no other long-scale drifts), with
no high-frequency line features, and without the attenuation at even
higher frequencies by the anti-aliasing filter, this is the
theoretical noise limit of the detectors. These measured variances are
stored, and then used in subsequent iterations to weight the data
points when calculating the map estimate (Section~\ref{sec:ast}). They
are also used for convergence tests (Section~\ref{sec:converge}).

Since noise estimation is usually calculated as the final step in the
iteration, the data at this stage have had most of the astronomical
and other large, low-frequency noise signals removed. For this reason,
\model{NOI} may optionally perform some cleaning options, such as the
DC step fixer (Section~\ref{sec:steps}) and spike detection
(Section~\ref{sec:timedespike}), which may work better with these
cleaner time-streams.

Finally, it should be noted that the default behaviour is to calculate
the white noise levels \emph{once} within \model{NOI}, after the second
iteration. The reason for fixing these values is to prevent any
potential divergence in the weight estimates with iterations, and also
to provide a fixed reference for the convergence tests
(Section~\ref{sec:converge}). Note that the absolute values of the
noise, and therefore weights calculated by the model component are
irrelevant (only their relative values). The reason is that the final
noise in the map is measured empirically from the scatter of the data
points that land in each pixel (Section~\ref{sec:ast}), and
large-scale noise sources can be checked by analyzing the angular
power spectra of jackknife maps (e.g., Section~\ref{sec:cosmo}).

\subsubsection{Other experimental models}

Additional models exist as options, altough they are not generally
used: \model{DKS}, the use of dark squids as a template for removing
magnetic field pickup; \model{TMP} which uses the azimuth of the
telescope also as a template for magnetic field pickup; \model{SMO},
which provides a time-domain smoothing alternative to the FFT-based
filter model \model{FLT}; and \model{PLN}, which fits a plane to the
signal distribution across the focal plane at each time slice in an
attempt to remove possible coherent atmospheric sky-noise structures.

As described in Section~\ref{sec:magpickup}, wide scans can produce
significant magnetic field pickup that tracks the azimuthal motion of
the telescope. The \model{DKS} model uses the dark squid signals for
each column as a template that is simply scaled (gain and offset) to
each bolometer time-series before removal. Since not all columns have
working dark squids, another alternative model is \model{TMP} in which
the azimuth of the telescope itself is used as the template. In both
cases, while the models had some success at removing the magnetic
field pickup, it did not reduce the $1/f$ knee substantially,
necessitating the continued use of the \model{FLT} model to remove the
remaining low-frequency noise. Little or no difference in the final
maps could be seen with or without the inclusion of these models, and
so they are not generally used.

The \model{SMO} model uses a rolling mean or median boxcar filter to
calculate the low-frequency component of the bolometer signals, which
are then removed. In other words, this is an alternative to the
high-pass filtering for which \model{FLT} is generally used. The
primary reason for developing this model was to make it more robust
against ringing near the ends of the time-series (since the FFT
assumes the signal is periodic, and there may be a large step between
the start and finish), or residual spikes (for which the median
filtering is particularly useful). However, the gap-filling and
continuity algorithms that we have employed (Section~\ref{sec:gaps})
successfully mitigate these problems, and the \model{FLT} model is
substantially faster,

Finally, we experimented with an alternative to \model{COM} for
removing correlated atmospheric noise. Rather than subtracting the
average signal at each time slice, \model{PLN} fits a plane to the
observed signal at each instant. We found that there was no obvious
improvement (either in terms of reducing the $1/f$ knee or reducing
the noise in final maps). This result is basically consistent with
those from earlier instruments, and suggests that the angular scale of
the emitting regions in the atmosphere are un-resolved at the \scuba\
focal plane. \citet{sayers2010}, in particular, examined several
different ways of modelling and removing the correlated atmospheric
noise from Bolocam data at 143 and 268\,GHz (also atop Mauna Kea),
finding only marginal improvements by fitting a plane, or even using
higher-order polynomials (see their Fig.~10, as well as the discussion
and references to earlier work in their Section~4.3).

\subsection{Convergence tests and model degeneracies}
\label{sec:converge}

The map-maker will halt if the convergence criteria have been
met. Presently there are two numerical tests that may be performed by
SMURF, or alternatively, a fixed number of iterations may be
specified. The first numerical test is an approximate check of the
change in reduced chi-squared, $\chi^2_\mathrm{r}$. The standard
deviations, $\sigma_i$, are measured for each of the residual
bolometer signals once the modelled signal components have been
removed. In the early iterations, the residual signals usually contain
both white noise, and other long-timescale features. However, once the
solution has converged, this signal should look approximately
white. Once the white nosie, $\mathbf{n}^\mathrm{w}_i(t)$, has been
measured from the bolometer PSDs in \model{NOI}
(Section~\ref{sec:noi}), $\chi^2_\mathrm{r}$ is calculated as $(1/N)
\sum_i \sigma^2_i / \mathbf{n}^\mathrm{w}_i(t)$, where $i$ runs over
the $N$ bolometers. In other words, it is the average ratio between
the measured time-series bolometer variances and their white-noise
levels measured between 2 and 10\,Hz. Note that this expression
\emph{does not account for the degrees of freedom}. Clearly there are
a large number of parameters in the model, which will ``fit-out'' some
of the uncorrelated white noise, and potentially bias this estimate of
$\chi^2_\mathrm{r}$ low. One approach would be to keep track of the
degrees of freedom, and therefore provide a correction, as in
\citet{kovacs2008}. However, note that we are only using this quantity
as a convergence test, and its value is not used in an absolute
sense. Furthermore, the reference white noise values are calculated
only once in SMURF (Section~\ref{sec:noi}), and the number of model
parameters are fixed, so the value of $\chi^2_\mathrm{r}$ should
decrease monotonically if the solution is behaving well. The
convergence criterion is met if the change in subsequent values of
$\chi^2_\mathrm{r}$ is smaller than the parameter \texttt{chitol},
which is set to $10^{-3}$ by default.

It was immediately found in the analysis of \scuba\ data that the
$\chi^2_\mathrm{r}$ test described above i not a sufficient stopping
criterion. The reason for this is that various components of the model
are, under normal circumstances, highly degenerate. One simple example
is the degeneracy between large-scale astronomical structures (larger
than the array footprint), and the common-mode rejection step
(\model{COM}), which will be illustrated in
Section~\ref{sec:point}. Since the flatness of the residual only
reflects the ability of the model to fit the shape of the bolometer
time-series, it does not necessarily correlate with convergence of the
most important model component: the map. Indeed, examination of the
map after large numbers of iterations (e.g., $>10$), shows the
presence of large-scale structures that are anti-correlated with
structures in other model components. For this reason, a second
map-based convergence test was added.

The map-based convergence statistic, $M_\mathrm{c}$, is the average
absolute change in the value of map pixels between subsequent
iterations, normalized by the map pixel uncertainties (square root of
Eq.~\ref{eq:varmap}), or
%
\begin{equation}
M^j_\mathrm{c} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \frac{| \mathbf{m}(x_j,y_j) -
  \mathbf{m}(x_{j-1},y_{j-1}) |} {\sqrt{\mathbf{v}(x_j,y_j)}} ,
\end{equation}
%
where $i$ runs over the $N$ map pixels, and $j$ enumerates the
iterations. The convergence criterion is met once this average change
is smaller than the parameter \texttt{maptol}. Experimentally we found
that a threshold of 0.05 gives good results (on average, map pixels
change by 5\% of the estimated map RMS in subsequent iterations).
This provides good correspondance with what we would choose ``by
eye'', and furthermore, letting the solver run for many more
iterations in several test cases yields insignificant differences.

Another major source of divergence is correlation between \model{COM}
and \model{FLT}. Since \model{FLT} usually consists of a high-pass
filter following the application of \model{COM}, \model{COM} is
completely free to grow any large-scale structure at frequencies below
the chosen filter edge. While such structure does not appear in the
map (as it is removed by \model{FLT}), we found that the solution
could be made to converge significantly faster by ``re-mixing''
\model{COM} and \model{FLT} at the start of each iteration. In
practice, at the start of each iteration, the previous iterations of
each model are both added back into the residual immediately prior to
re-calculating \model{COM}. In this way, truly common-mode signals,
even at low-frequencies, do not leak into \model{FLT}.

%-------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Data preparation}
%-------------------------------------------------

In this section we describe a number of data preparation steps that
preceed the calculation of model components as described in the
previous section.

\subsubsection{Time-series down-sampling and map pixel size}
\label{sec:downsamp}

The highest useful frequency in the nominally 200\,Hz-sampled
\scuba\ data is that which corresponds to the smallest angular scale
that the instrument is sensitive to. As mentioned earlier, the usual
rule-of-thumb for a Gaussian beam is to provide at least 3 samples for
each FWHM, or roughly 2.5\,arcsec for the 7.5\,arcsec
450\,\micron\ channel, and 5\,arcsec for the 14.5\,arcsec
850\,\micron\ channel. For a typical scan speed of
300\,arcsec\,s$^{-1}$, the maximum useful sample rate is therefore
about 120\,Hz at 450\,\micron, and 40\,Hz at 850\,\micron. In order to
save execution time and memory usage (both of which scale linearly
with data volume), it is clearly advantageous to re-sample the data to
these lower rates.

Similarly, from the point of view of retaining all of the useful
information, the size of the output map pixels need not be any smaller
than the FWHM/3 rule. Larger pixels may be selected, but at the
expense of retaining information at the diffraction limit of the
telescope.  \textbf{ Per: loss of information?}.


The default behaviour of SMURF is to select output map pixel sizes of
2 and 4\,arcsec at 450 and 850\,\micron, respectively (slightly
over-sampled). The slew speed of the telescope (approximately constant
for all standard scan modes) is then used to calculate the highest
useful frequency for the time-series given the map pixel size,
$f_\mathrm{max}$. The data are then re-sampled to this new rate prior
to map-making (as well as the data cleaning steps).

The method used by SMURF to down-sample simply averages together
multiple samples from the original time-series, $x_i$ to estimate the
lower-frequency output time-series, $y_j$. In general there will not
be an integer number of samples from $x_i$ in each of the $y_j$, so
fractional samples from $x_i$ are used at the $y_j$ time
boundaries. The algorithm is fast, since each sample in $x_i$ need
only be visited once. From a spectral point of view, this boxcar
average is equivalent to applying a sinc-function low-pass filter in
frequency space. Such behaviour is desirable, since it serves as an
anti-aliasing filter; most non-white features above the Nyquist
frequency in $y_j$ that could contaminate the output data are largely
removed.

As an alternative, we also investigated an algorithm in which the FFT
of $x_i$ is simply truncated to the target sample rate before
transforming back to the time domain (i.e., applying a hard-edged
low-pass filter). In practice the noise performance was
indistinguishable, and required slightly more execution time, using
this method compared to the boxcar method described above. It is
therefore not currently available to users.

\subsubsection{Bolometer filtering}

Despite the ability of the map-maker to iteratively remove many noise
components, under some circumstances it may be desirable to filter the
data \emph{once} during the pre-processing step. Three main filtering
options are available:

\begin{itemize}

\item The most commonly-used pre-processing filter is polynomial
subtraction. A polynomial of the requested order is fit and removed
from each bolometer time-series. At a bare minimum, the mean is
removed from all of the bolometers (order 0) in all reductions
described in this paper.

\item All of the filters available as part of the iterative Fourier
Transform Filter (Section~\ref{sec:flt}) can also be applied once
during pre-processing.

\item As a complete alternative to the iterative map-making procedure,
cleaning by principal component analysis (PCA) is available as an
experimental pre-processing option. As described in
Section~\ref{sec:pca}, a new set of basic vectors for the bolometer
data are found which diagonalize their covariance matrix. The
brightest components can then be subtracted from the data. A single
parameter specifies the threshold on the amplitude of the eigenvalues
to be removed, as a number of standard deviations away from the mean
value. Subarrays are cleaned independently once for the full length of
each continuousy chunk of data. Given the computational expense of
this method, and initial tests which showed little improvement over
simple high-pass filtering, this method has not yet been explored in
detail with \scuba\ data. However, since systematic effects seem to
come and go, it is possible that PCA could be useful for particular
data sets.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Time-domain de-spiking}
\label{sec:timedespike}

Spikes of short duration and high amplitude are often seen in the time
series data. If not removed, they can cause ringing in the FLT model
(Section~\ref{sec:flt}). Two alternative approaches may be used to
remove these spikes. This section describes the detection and removal
of spikes within the time series of each bolometer, and
section~\ref{sec:mapdespike} describes the detection and removal of
spikes within the final map. In practice, map-based despiking
(Section~\ref{sec:mapdespike}) usually gives superior results, and so
time-domain despiking is usually switched off.

Each one-dimensional bolometer time series is processed
independently. At each time slice, the median value of the current
bolometer is found in a box centred on the time slice, and containing
a specified number of time slices (typically 50). If the residual
between the time slice value and the median value is greater than some
specified multiple (typically 10) of the local noise level, the time
slice is flagged as a spike.

If the local noise level were estimated within the same box used to
determine the median value, a spike in the box would cause the local
noise level to be over-estimated severely. For this reason, the local
noise level is taken as the standard deviation of the values within a
neighbouring box on the ``down-stream'' side of the median box (that
is, the side that has already been checked for spikes). In other
words, the high end of the noise box is just below the low end of the
median filter box. This introduces a slight asymmetry in the noise,
but this should not matter unless the noise varies significantly on a
time scale shorter than the box size.

This simple algorithm is not very good at distinguishing between spikes
and bright point sources, and so the threshold for spike detection is
usually raised when making maps of bright point sources.

\subsubsection{Step correction}
\label{sec:steps}

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{steps1.pdf}
\caption{Examples of steps in time series data. Steps occur with a wide
range of heights from the large steps shown on the left to the small
steps shown on the right. Large steps are often followed by a brief
``over-shoot'' as shown on the left. In both plots, the black curve is
the uncorrected time series, and the red curve is the corrected time
series. Samples close to a step are omitted in the corrected time series.
In the right hand plot, the blue curve is the uncorrected time series for
a nearby bolometer. The similarity between the red and blue curves shows
that the step correction is performing well.
}
\label{fig:steps1}
\end{figure*}

Sudden steps can occur in the time stream data from each bolometer,
with the most likely cause being wraparound in the first stage squid
amplification, the details of which are given in \citet{holland2012}
\textbf{Per gave a technical explanation, but this is probably best in
another paper?}.

The black curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:steps1} show examples of such steps in
the time streams for two bolometers. If not removed, these steps can
cause severe ringing in the FLT model (Section~\ref{sec:flt}) and visible
streaks in the final map, corresponding to the paths of individual
bolometers over the sky.

Steps occur with a wide range of heights and shapes. The ratio of step
height to noise can vary from less than 10 to several hundred. Some
steps occur over a single sample, such as the step close to sample
5000 in the right-hand plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:steps1}, but others
happen more gradually, such as the step close to sample 5300. In
addition, a step can be preceded or followed by a short period of
instability, as is visible at the bottom of the step in the left hand
plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:steps1}. Further problems are caused by steps
that occur close together in time, such as the large downward step
followed by a smaller upward step close to sample 5000 in the right
hand plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:steps1}.

Detecting and correcting such a wide variety of steps reliably has proved
to be a challenge. The current step-correction algorithm is described in
detail in Appendix~\ref{appendix:steps}. In outline, the following stages
are involved in detecting steps in a single bolometer time stream:

\begin{enumerate}

\item median smooth the whole time stream;

\item find the gradient of the median smoothed time series at each
sample;

\item smooth the gradient values to determine the local mean gradient
and subtract this local mean from the total gradient to get residual
gradient;

\item find residual gradient values that exceed 25 times the local RMS
of the residual gradients;

\item Group these high residual gradients into contiguous blocks of
samples;

\item merge blocks that are separated by less than 100 samples.
\end{enumerate}

The above process produces a list of candidate steps in each bolometer
time series. Each candidate step is then verified, measured and corrected
using the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}

\item the above process can mis-interpret the edges of a bright source
as a step, so we ignore blocks that occur close to bright sources;

\item if the block passes the above test, a least squares linear fit
is performed to the median-filtered bolometer data just before the
block, and this fit is extrapolated to predict the data value expected
at the centre of the block on the basis of the preceding data;

\item a least squares linear fit is performed to the median-filtered
bolometer data just after the block, and this fit is extrapolated to
predict the data value expected at the centre of the block on the
basis of the following data;

\item the difference between these two expected data values is taken
as the step height;

\item the preceding three steps are repeated several times, each time
including a different selection of samples in the two least squares
fits, with the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding set of
step heights found;

\item if the mean step height is small compared to the standard deviation
of the step heights, or compared to the noise in the bolometer data, then
the step is ignored;

\item if the above checks are passed, all subsequent bolometer samples
are corrected by the mean step height;

\item bolometer samples within the duration of the step, and a few
samples on either side, are flagged as unusable.

\end{enumerate}

Once all steps have been corrected within a bolometer time stream, a
constant value is added to all samples in the time stream to restore its
original mean value.

The results of step correction are shown by the red curves in
Fig.~\ref{fig:steps1}. For comparison, the blue curve shows the
uncorrected time stream from a nearby bolometer that does not suffer from
steps. The agreement between the red and blue curves confirms that
the step correction algorithm is working satisfactorily.


\subsubsection{Gap filling / apodization}
\label{sec:gaps}

The evaluation of the \model{FLT} model (Section~\ref{sec:flt})
involves taking the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of each bolometer
time series. Data that have been flagged as bad for any reason (for
instance, due to the presence of spikes, steps, or unusual common-mode
signal) need to be excluded from this FFT. Two methods are available:

\begin{itemize}
\item Gap-filling: each contiguous block of bad data samples is filled
with artificial data before taking the FFT. A least squares linear fit is
performed to the 50 samples preceding the block, and a similar fit is
performed to the 50 samples following the block. These are used to
estimate the expected values at the start and end of the block of bad
values. The bad values are then replaced by linear interpolation between
the expected start and end values. Gaussian noise is added with a
standard deviation equal to the mean of the RMS residuals in the two
fits.

\item Masking: each bad data value is replaced by zero, and an
associated mask is created that holds 1.0 for each good sample in the
time stream and 0.0 for each bad sample. The masked data and the mask
are then each filtered in the same way using FFTs, and the filtered
data are finally normalised by dividing them by the filtered mask.
\end{itemize}

In addition to replacing bad samples before the FFT, it is also
necessary to ensure that the data values at the start and end of the
time series are similar. Since an FFT treats the data as a single
cycle in an infinitely repeating waveform, any large difference
between starting and ending value will effectively introduce sudden
steps at the start and end of each cycle, causing unwanted
oscillations (ringing) in the transform. Another consequence of the
cyclic nature of the FFT is that features at one end of the time
series can affect the filtered values at the other end of the time
series. Two methods are available to avoid these two problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item Apodisation: a number of samples at the start and end of each
bolometer time series are multiplied by a cosine function in order to
roll the data values off smoothly to zero. The default number of samples
modified at each end of the time series is given by half the ratio of the
sampling frequency to the lowest retained frequency. In addition, each
end of the time stream is padded with double this number of zeros. This
method is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:pad2}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pad2.pdf}
\caption{The black curve shows a bolometer time stream, padded
with zeros. The red curve shows the time stream after apodisation.}
\label{fig:pad2}
\end{figure}

\item Padding with artificial data: instead of padding with zeros,
each time stream is padded with artificial data that connects the two
ends of the data stream smoothly and includes Gaussian noise. No
apodisation is performed. The number of samples of padding at each end
is again equal to the ratio of the sampling frequency to the lowest
retained frequency.  This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:pad1}. See
\citet{stompor2002} for a thorough discussion of this procedure within
the context of CMB map-making.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pad1.pdf}
\caption{The black curve shows the same bolometer time stream as in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pad2}, againpadded with zeros. The red curve shows the
time stream after padding with artificial data.}

\end{figure}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Flatfields}
\label{sec:flatfields}

TJ

Discuss heater ramps, normalizing off the common-mode signal
amplitude, astronomical sources, and the internal flatfield source.

\textit{Surely flatfields are discussed in the main \scuba\ paper so
don't really have any useful purpose here since they aren't
technically part of the map-maker.}

\subsubsection{Additional bad bolometer rejection}

TJ

Measuring the noise power spectra and throwing away outliers. Data
flagged bad by the DA system.

\subsubsection{Map-based despiking}
\label{sec:mapdespike}

It is possible to use the map estimate (Section~\ref{sec:ast}) to
provide additional despiking of the time-series. Unlike the
time-domain despiker (Section~\ref{sec:timedespike}), this calculation
uses the scatter in the population of samples used to estimate the map
pixel values (from different times and bolometers) to reject
outliers. This method is more robust against false-positive detections
of bright/compact astronomical sources, since transient features in the
time-series are unlikely to occur by chance whenever a bolometer
crosses a specific location on the sky, whereas real astronomical
sources are at fixed spatial locations.

The estimated variance, $\mathbf{v_p}(x_i,y_i)$, of the normalized
weighted samples that land in the $i$th map pixel is simply the biased
weighted sample variance (i.e., the variance map value multiplied by
the number of samples)
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{v_p}(x_i,y_i) = N_i \mathbf{v}(x_i,y_i).
\end{equation}

In order to compare the weighted \emph{differences} between the
samples and the map values, [$\mathbf{b}_j - \mathbf{m}(x_i,y_i)$] to
$\mathbf{v_p}$, they must be scaled appropriately. We define a
normalized difference, $\mathbf{d}_j$, in such a way that the variance
of this new variable gives the weighted sample variance of the
underlying data points:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\sum_j \mathbf{d}_j^2}{N} &=&
  \frac{\sum_j \mathbf{w}_j [\mathbf{b}_j - \mathbf{m}(x_i,y_i)]^2}
       {\sum_k \mathbf{w}_k} \\
   \Rightarrow \mathbf{d}_j^2 &=& \frac{N \mathbf{w}_j [\mathbf{b}_j -
       \mathbf{m}(x_i,y_i)]^2}{ \sum_k \mathbf{w}_k} .
\end{eqnarray}
%
The map-based despiker flags those $\mathbf{d}_j$ that are further
than some threshold number of standard deviations,
$\sqrt{\mathbf{v_p}}$, away from zero so that they are not used in
subsequent iterations.

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section three different common types of data are reduced: a
bright point source, Uranus (Section~\ref{sec:point}); a blind survey
of high-redshift galaxies in the Lockman Hole
(Section~\ref{sec:cosmo}); and a map of a bright extended star-forming
region in our Galaxy, M17 (Section~\ref{sec:extended}). In each case,
variations on the default algorithm from Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}
are described.

%-------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Known point source}
\label{sec:point}
%-------------------------------------------------

The accurate measurement of positions and brightnesses of known point
sources are necessary in real-time to establish telescope pointing
offsets and focus. They are also necessary to measure the FCF
(absolute calibration), and hence noise performance of the instrument
in astronomical units.  In this example we produce a 450\,\micron\ map
of Uranus (observation 26 on 20111017), which is a nearly point-like
source for \scuba\ that is commonly used as a primary flux
calibrator. The now standard constant-velocity daisy scan pattern was
used (Section~\ref{sec:scan}), with a scan speed of 155
arcsec\,sec$^{-1}$. We perform several different reductions of the
data to illustrate the purpose of various model components and the
convergence properties of the solution (Fig.~\ref{fig:pointmaps}). In
all cases the maps are produced on a grid of azimuth (horizontal) and
elevation (vertical) offsets from the position of Uranus (the origin),
using 2\,arcsec pixels.

The first, simplest reduction of the data uses only the \model{COM}
model to estimate and remove the common-mode signal in order to
suppress low-frequency noise in the data. After \model{COM}, the
extinction correction is applied (\model{EXT}), and an initial map is
estimated using equal weighting for all of the detectors. This
estimate of \model{AST} is then removed from the data, and the noise
is measured in the residuals to estimate weights for the subsequent
and final iteration. The resulting map after these two iterations is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pointmaps}a. While the \snr\ of Uranus is clearly
large ($\sim$250 as estimated by SMURF), enabling us to see the faint
sidelobes (circle and cross pattern), the map also has obvious
circular streaks and other large-scale ripples. The circular streaks
are due to the fact that \model{COM} does not account for all of the
low-frequency noise (see Fig.~\ref{fig:pspec}), and therefore each
bolometer leaves a trace of the circular scan pattern in the map as
each of their baselines slowly drift independently. A significant
contribution to the larger-scale ripples in the map, however, can be
made by degeneracies in the map solution, as we discuss below.

To illustrate how large-scale ripples can form (and grow), the same
map solution is run for 100 iterations and shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pointmaps}b, now exhibiting a strong vertical
gradient. The degeneracy is easy to understand if the time-domain
behaviour of each model component is considered. The top panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:degeneracy} shows the residual signals for a single
bolometer after 2 (black) and 100 (grey) iterations which are nearly
identical, yet the \emph{change} in the estimated \model{COM} (green)
and \model{AST} (red) signals between 2 and 100 iterations are
large. However, it is also clear that the estimated \model{COM} and
\model{AST} signals are \emph{complimentary}. In other words, the
large change in the \model{AST} signal is cancelled by freedom in the
\model{COM} signal to grow with opposite sign. For comparison, the
bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:degeneracy} shows the pointing solution
for this section of data, and the shapes of the \model{AST} and
\model{COM} signals match the elevation component, which is aligned
with the gradient in Fig.~\ref{fig:pointmaps}b. Generically, the
calculation of \model{COM} will remove any information on angular
scales that are larger than the array footprint (outline shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:pointmaps}b for reference), meaning that the map
solution is unconstrained on such large scales.

One improvement is to simply restrict the low-frequency signal that
goes into the maps by applying a high-pass filter to the bolometer
time-series. A third reduction of the data uses the default map-making
parameters, as described in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}, which adds
the \model{FLT} model to accomplish this task immediately prior to map
estimation. We set the filter edge based on an angular scale of
200\,arcsec, which, given the scan speed of 155\,arcsec\,sec$^{-1}$,
corresponds to a frequency of 0.78\,Hz. Now using the automatic
map-based convergence test (Section~\ref{sec:converge}), the resulting
map converges after 10 iterations (Fig.~\ref{fig:pointmaps}c). Both
the circular streaks and the large-scale gradient are now removed, but
they have been replaced by an obvious, circularly-symmetric ringing
pattern about Uranus. The reason for this ringing is that the
hard-edged high-pass filter in frequency space is equivalent to a
$\sinc$ function-like response in map space. Since the scan pattern is
fairly isotropic (scans at all position angles), and there is a bright
point-like source at the centre, the result is an
azimuthally-symmetric $\sinc$ function-like pattern in the map. Note
that due to the iterative nature of the solution, much of the signal
in the source is actually removed for subsequent iterations of
\model{FLT}, but as in the previous case, degeneracies between the map
and the \model{FLT} and \model{COM} signal components can still lead
to complicated structures.

The preceding examples illustrate the need for constraints in the map
solution in many situations. For calibrators (and other previously
known bright, compact sources), a good, simple prior is to constrain
the map to a value of zero away from the known locations of
emission. In Fig.~\ref{fig:pointmaps}d, a solution is produced in an
identical manner to the previous example, but now setting the map
explicitly to zero beyond a radius of 60\,arcsec from the location of
Uranus (much larger than the FWHM of the main lobe), for all but the
final iteration. In this case, the map converges after 6 iterations,
and all of the previous artifacts have been effectively removed. Since
the map is now flat away from the source, and constrained to a value
of zero, it is appropriate for performing aperture photometry
directly, with no need for an additional reference annulus. This
approach to constrained map-making is similar to that employed for
poorly cross-linked scans of compact (though resolved) sources by
\citet{wiebe2009} using BLAST data.

  subtraction is used to suppress low-frequency noise, and the
  reduction is forced to use 2 iterations (after the first iteration

  and the solution halts after 10 iterations, but leaving large-scale

\subsection{Deep blind survey}
\label{sec:cosmo}
%-------------------------------------------------

\scuba\ surveys designed to detect extremely faint point-sources
(e.g. high-redshift star-forming galaxies, and debris disks) are
ideally limited by the white-noise performance of the instrument. The
approach described here for maximizing the \snr\ of point-sources
involves three major steps: (i) generating a map that removes most
low-frequency noise sources with approximately linear response,
without prior knowledge of the location of sources; (ii)
\emph{whitening} (essentially flattening) the map to make the noise
properties of the map easier to deal with; and (iii) detecting point
sources using a \emph{matched-filter}. Note that variations on this
general procedure have been used extensively in the submm cosmology
community using previous instruments
\citep[e.g.][]{scott2002,borys2003,laurent2005,coppin2006,scott2008,perera2008,devlin2009}.
In this section we will reduce scans of the Lockman Hole taken during
S2SRO as a pilot project for the Cosmology Legacy Survey. It consists
of $\sim8.5$\,hours of data taken in 36 separate scans (average
15\,min. each) spread over February and March 2010, covering an area
of about 50\,arcmin$^2$. The full list of dates and observation
numbers includes: 20100218, 63, 64, 65, 70, 71, 72, 90, 91, 92, 97,
98, 99; 20100220, 111, 112, 113, 118, 128, 129, 130; 20100303, 61, 62,
64, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 75; 20100309, 87, 88, 90, 91; and 20100311,
59, 64, 65, 72. These observations represent about 80 per cent of the
total data taken as part of the project; the remaining observations
were dropped due to problems keeping the arrays properly tuned during
S2SRO, and were easily identified by their highly variable and erratic
bolometer time-series (which resulted in maps full of large streaks).


\begin{figure*}

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{lockman_maps.pdf}
\caption{Reduction of a blank-field survey: the Lockman Hole. (a) Raw

  radio sources from \citet{owen2008} with $S\gsim15$\,$\mu$Jy. Of the

  radio source. (d) Jackknife map produced from the difference of two

  panel (c), there is only a single (apparently) significant peak, and
  it is not in the vicinity of a radio source.}
\label{fig:lockman_maps}
\end{figure*}

The first step, map generation, is different from that described in
Section~\ref{sec:point} in two key ways. Since the locations of
sources are unknown \emph{a priori}, a map constraint is not
employed. Large-scale diverging structures in the map must be
mitigated, and the method used in this example (the default processing
in SMURF) is to apply a high-pass filter to the data \emph{once} as a
pre-processing step. The iterative solution is then run using only
\model{COM}, \model{EXT}, \model{AST}, and \model{NOI}. In other
words, there is no information in the bolometer signals below some
cutoff frequency, and residual correlated high-frequency noise above
the cutoff is only removed through iterative common-mode
subtraction. The map is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}a. The
map-maker has been tested in two ways: (i) large numbers of iterations
are used to verify that the maps converge without the growth of large
structure; and (ii) adding synthetic sources to the data at a range of
brightnesses verify that the map-maker response to them is
\emph{linear} (i.e. the relative shape and amplitude compared to the
input source is independent of brightness). The response to a
synthetic point source (solid line) after map-making (dotted line) is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_psf}. Clearly the use of a high-pass
filter as a pre-processing step, and having no other map-constraints,
has the down-side of introducing sidelobes around the main
peak. However, the way this filter affects point-sources is both
well-known, and linear.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{lockman_psf.pdf}
\caption{Slice through the angular response to an ideal Gaussian point
  source (solid line) along the R.A. axis following map-making using
  the default blank-field processing with SMURF (dotted line), and
  upon application of the whitening filter (dashed line). The ``map
  filtered'' response is produced by adding the ideal Gaussian to the
  real data near the centre of the Lockman Hole map, and re-reducing
  the data. The resulting dotted line gives the expected shape of a
  source in panel (a) from Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}. Applying the
  whitening filter (reciprocal of the solid orange line in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_pspec}) to the dotted line gives the whitened
  line, which is the expected shape of a source in panel (b) from
  Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}. Finally, cross-correlating the whitened
  map with this whitened PSF is an effective ``matched filter'' for
  identifying point-like sources, and this smoothed map is shown in
  panel (c) of Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}.}
\label{fig:lockman_psf}
\end{figure}

Even though the map looks quite flat, there is a mixture of faint
astronomical sources, and what is probably residual low-frequency
noise,q causing faint ripples visible to the naked eye. Since the
mixture of the two components is unknown, the first step is to
suppress the low-frequency noise, under the assumption that such
contaminants occur randomly in time, while astronomical sources are
(usually) constant.

First, the angular power spectrum of noise is estimated from a
\emph{jackknife map}: maps are produced from two independent halves of
the total data set, and the jackknife signal in a map pixel,
$S_\mathrm{JK}$, and its variance, $\sigma^2_\mathrm{JK}$ are
estimated from the two input map fluxes, $S_1$, $S_2$, and the
corresponding variances, $\sigma^2_1$, and $\sigma^2_2$ as,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_\mathrm{JK} = \frac{S_1 - S_2}{2}, \\
\sigma^2_\mathrm{JK} = \frac{\sigma^2_1 + \sigma^2_2}{4}.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Provided that the noise in one half of the data is uncorrelated with
that from the other half, the signal in the jackknife map should
resemble noise drawn from the same parent distribution as that of the
real map. The astronomical signal, however, should be cleanly removed
(provided that there are no strong time-varying signals, and also
assuming that errors due to calibration between the two halves are
insignificant). The approach we have taken to minimize systematics is
to produce the two maps using odd and even scan numbers (i.e., each
map will contain a nearly evenly-spaced sampling of data across the
full data set).

Since the \scuba\ scan strategy is usually isotropic (all position
angles scanned with roughly equal weights), we make the simplifying
assumption that the angular noise power spectrum is azimuthally
symmetric. For these data, there are no obvious anisotropic structures
in the 2-dimensional FFT. The radial (azimuthally-averaged) angular
power spectrum therefore encodes all of the useful information about
the noise properties. These power spectra for the raw output of SMURF,
and the jackknife map (transforming only the approximately uniform
region indicated by the square in Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}d in each
case) are shown by the dashed black, and solid orange lines in
Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_pspec}, respectively. Both power spectra are
approximately flat at spatial frequencies $\gsim 0.06$\,arcsec$^{-1}$
(scales $\lsim16$\,arcsec), with the exception of a line at
$\sim0.175$\,arcsec$^{-1}$ (a scale of $\sim5.7$\,arcsec). One
possibility for this feature is that it is related to the
inter-bolometer spacing in the focal plane (which happens to be this
size): small relative drifts in the baselines of adjacent bolometers
may produce faint parallel stripes in the map along the scan direction
(the superposition of many scans at different angles then results in
an isotropic noise pattern). It is not likely that this signal is due
to astronomical sources because it appears with a nearly equal
amplitude in both the real map and the jackknife.  At lower spatial
frequencies, both the real map and the jackknife power spectra grow
significantly, as a result of the more obvious large-scale undulations
in Figs.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}(a) and (d).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{lockman_pspec.pdf}
\caption{Radial (azimuthally-averaged) angular power spectral
  densities for the raw map output by SMURF (dashed black line), the
  jackknife (solid orange line), and whitened (solid black line) maps
  (panels (a), (d), and (b) from Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps},
  respectively, considering only the square region indicated in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}d. Since the raw map contains spatially
  correlated signals on large scales, both due to noise and
  astronomical signals (low-spatial frequencies), the jackknife map
  (difference of two approximately equal-length subsets of the data)
  is used to generate a plausible realization of pure noise. Assuming
  that the noise properties are isotropic, a whitening filter is
  estimated from the reciprocal of the jackknife power spectrum with
  only a radial dependence. The power spectrum of the resulting signal
  map still has residual power on large scales, which is presumably
  due to astronomical sources.}
\label{fig:lockman_pspec}
\end{figure}

To suppress noise in the map, we construct a \emph{whitening filter}
from the reciprocal of the jackknife angular power spectrum (orange
line in Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_pspec}), normalized by the white-noise
level estimated from the RMS power at angular frequencies $>
0.1$\,arcsec$^{-1}$. The filter is applied by scaling the power
spectrum of the map by this function, and then transforming back into
real space. The whitened map is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}b,
and for comparison, the jackknife map has also been whitened in
Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}e. In both cases, the maps are visually
flatter than the non-whitened cases.

The angular power spectrum of the whitened signal map is shown with a
solid line in Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_pspec}. At low angular frequencies
($\lsim 0.5$\,arcsec$^{-1}$) there is significantly less power than
the raw map. However, it also clearly has \emph{some} power in excess
of the white noise level. In theory, this residual signal is produced
by astronomical sources, although its origin cannot be determined from
this plot alone; nor are astronomical sources readily visible in the
map (Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}b). To identify sources, we next apply
a \emph{matched filter} to the whitened maps.

For blind, high-redshift surveys, individual sources are expected to
be un-resolved by the \scuba\ 7.5--14.5\,arcsec FWHM beams. Under this
assumption, cross-correlation between the map and the known PSF yields
the maximum-likelihood flux density of supposed point-sources centered
over every location in the resulting map \citep[an extremely
well-known result throughout astronomy, see][]{stetson1987}. Peak
identification in such smoothed maps have been used extensively in the
submillimetre community as both an efficient source-detection and
photometric measurement strategy. In terms of the angular power
spectrum, a matched-filter may also be thought of as an optimal
\emph{low-pass} filter, that suppresses noise on scales smaller (and
therefore higher angular frequencies) than the beam. For the case at
hand, the effective PSF for the whitened maps is given by the dotted
curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_psf}. Maps smoothed by this shape are
shown for the whitened signal, and jackknife maps in
Figs.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}c and f, respectively. Note that these
images are plotted in \snr\ units, where the smooth noise maps have
been calculated by propagating the original noise maps output by SMURF
both through the whitening and matched filters (each of which are
linear operations).

Have real astronomical sources been detected using the matched-filter?
For both the smoothed signal and jackknife maps, orange circles denote
3.8-$\sigma$ peaks. While not justified here, this threshold is fairly
typical for other ground-based submillimetre surveys in recent years
\citep[e.g.,][]{coppin2006,perera2008,2009ApJ...707.1201W} leading to
estimated false-identification rates of order $\sim$5\%, and is chosen
as a convenient reference. In the former, 10 peaks are found, whereas
there is only 1 in the latter. However, this test does not preclude
the possibility that some correlated noise made it into the jackknife
map, in which case the estimated \snr s are misleading.

One simple test of the calculated noise properties is to compare the
signal and jackknife \snr\ distributions with ideal Gaussians. The top
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_hist} shows the whitened (but not
match-filtered) signal (blue) and jackknife (histograms), along with a
Gaussian (mean 0, standard deviation 1, and area normalized to the
number of map pixels) as a dashed line. In this case, it is clear that
the \snr\ distributions for both maps are nearly indistinguishable
from the theoretical distribution of white noise. This result shows us
that: (i) the whitening filter appears to have removed correlated
large-scale noise, since the jackknife map histogram is consistent
with white noise; and (ii) any potential astronomical signals are
small compared to the typical white noise in most map pixels
(unsurprising given the appearance of
Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}b). Next, we examine the \snr\ histograms
for maps processed with the matched filter in the bottom panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:lockman_hist}. Again, the histogram of the jackknife
\snr\ data appears consistent with pure noise. However, the signal map
now deviates significantly from a Gaussian distribution, with a clear
\emph{positive} tail (as one would expect for emitting sources). In
fact, integrating the positive tails beyond our 3.8-$\sigma$
source-detection threshold (vertical solid line) yields 229 map pixels
in the signal map, compared with 3 in the jackknife map (out of 80603
pixels in the entire region). Recall that given the small pixel size
of the map, several pixels generally contribute to each peak. Note
that this procedure gives only a flavour of the analysis that is
usually required to produce a robust source lists. Additional tests,
along with a careful consideration of completeness and false-positive
rates usual require a series of Monte Carlo simulations that are
beyond the scope of this work. We direct the interested reader to a
selection of papers on the subject:
\citet{scott2002,coppin2006,perera2008,2009ApJ...707.1201W} and
\citet{chapin2011}.

  pixels from the whitened signal and jackknife maps
  (Figs.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}b,e), compared to a Gaussian
  distribution with mean zero, standard deviation one, and an area

  distribution for a map of spatially-uncorrelated Gaussian noise. The
  good agreement indicates that these maps are indeed dominated by
  white noise. The lower panel shows the results for matched-filtered
  signal and jackknife maps (Figs.~\ref{fig:lockman_maps}c,f). The

\label{fig:lockman_hist}
\end{figure}

As an additional external check, we have over-plotted orange ``$+$''
signs at the locations of 1.4\,GHz radio sources from \citet{owen2008}
with $S\gsim15$\,$\mu$Jy. Such radio catalogues have historically
proven invaluable for the precise identifications of high-redshift
submillimetre galaxies due to their relatively low surface densities
(compare with optical catalogues, for example), and a strong
correlation between the radio and submillimetre emission mechanisms
\citep[e.g.][]{smail2000,pope2006,ivison2007,chapin2009b}. Taking a
representative search radius of 8\,arcsec from these studies with
similar \snr\ sources and source sizes (the same size as the blue
circles), 9 out of 10 peaks in the smoothed signal map have potential
radio counterparts, whereas the single peak in the smoothed jackknife
map does not lie near any radio source. Again, a proper
cross-identification analysis must inevitably include simulations to
establish completeness, false-positive rates, as well as the effects
of point source clustering and confusion. See the aforementioned
papers and references therein for examples.

default parameters (the solution halted after reaching the default
map-based convergence criterion in 30 iterations). Panel (a) also
depicts the array footprint (position angle indicative of the start of
the observation), and a 300\,arcsec line shows the spatial scale
corresponding to the default \model{FLT} high-pass filter. Similar to
Fig.~\ref{fig:pointmaps}c, the lack of prior constraints on the map
leads to degeneracies, and therefore ripples on scales larger than the
array footprint (due to common-mode subtraction) and filter scale
(especially evident around the brightest peak at the centre of the
map). Panels (c) and (d) show the ``bright extended'' reduction, in
which a zero-mask is created iteratively from all of the pixels that
exceed an \snr\ of 5. While this region (red contour) only encompasses
the brightest peaks early in the solution, in the final iteration it
identifies most of the bright, extended emission, and significantly
helps with negative ringing.}
\label{fig:m17}
\end{figure*}

For future, significantly deeper \scuba\ maps, in which the RMS in a
PSF-smoothed map is dominated by point-source confusion, rather than
instrumental noise, a modified matched-filter will offer improved
results. See Appendix~A in \citet{chapin2011}, which shows how to
include confusion (when known \emph{a priori}) explicitly as a noise
term in the calculation of such filters.

%-------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Bright extended emission}
\label{sec:extended}
%-------------------------------------------------

In this final example, we analyze a map of M17 which contains bright,
extended emission, in contrast with the earlier two examples. A
promise of \scuba\ is to recover larger angular scales than what was
possible with earlier-generation ground-based submillimetre
cameras. The two main factors contributing to this expectation are:
(i) a larger array footprint on the sky which should make the
subtraction of common sky-emission signals more effective; and (ii)
fast detectors (with a correspondingly fast sample rate) to enable
higher slew-rates (up to 600\,arcsec\,s$^{-1}$) to capture as much
large-scale structure as possible above the detector $1/f$ knees. We
produce maps of observation 11 on 20110531 using the 850\,\micron\
array. It is a rotating PONG covering a diameter of 0.375\,deg, with a
scan speed of 300\,arcsec\,s$^{-1}$, and a transverse spacing of
180\,arcsec, taking 37.5\,min to complete.

The default reduction of these data is shown in the top panels of
Fig.~\ref{fig:m17}, after 2 iterations (the first map estimated after
the noise weights have been measured) and 17 iterations (when the map
has converged). The first panel also depicts the array footprint, and
the angular scale corresponding to the high-pass filter edge. Much
like the reduction of a point source without any prior constraints
(Fig.~\ref{fig:pointmaps}c), degeneracies on scales larger than the
array footprint and filter produce ripples in the map.

Unlike the case of a known point-source (Section~\ref{sec:point}), it
may not be possible for the observer to define, in advance, a mask of
regions containing blank sky. Indeed, for this map, much of the field
clearly contains extended structure. Furthermore, the goal of such
maps may be to detect \emph{previously unknown} cool, dense regions of
the ISM that may not have appeared at other wavelengths (e.g. the
first optically-thick cloud-collapse stages of star-formation). While
the option does exist for the user to supply their own mask, a
facility has been added to SMURF to generate one automatically by
flagging pixels above some \snr\ threshold after each iteration as part
of the ``bright extended'' configuration.

The results of this automatic masking are shown in the bottom panels
of Fig.~\ref{fig:m17}. After the second iteration, only narrow regions
around the brightest peaks are identified. However, as the solution
progresses, the negative bowls around the bright sources are slowly
reduced and the mask ``grows'' out from the brightest areas. By the
final iteration, most of the obvious structures in the data are
encompassed by the mask, negative bowling is significantly reduced,
and the brightest regions are clearly more extended.

default configuration. The data have had added to them synthetic
signal within a 600\,arcsec diameter circle (south of M17) created as
a realization of noise from a $P(k) \propto k^{-3}$ angular power
spectrum multiplied by the PSF, subtracting the minimum to make it
positive, scaling it to a similar signal range as M17 itself, and
rolling-off the edges smoothly using half a period of a radial

increased, due to the high \snr\ of the data, larger emission regions
are (correctly) detected and reproduced in the map. Fourth (bottom)

remaining lines are as in the left panel, but now corrected by the

although the \snr\ worsens at smaller scales ($\lsim$200\,arcsec).}

configuration, although it is still noticeably larger up to scales of
about 60\,arcsec.}
\label{fig:m17_be_ps}
\end{figure*}

While the reduction in the bottom panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:m17} is
clearly superior, in at least a cosmetic sense to those in the top
panels, it is important to quantify both the noise properties of the
maps and their response to real structures (the transfer function). We
would also like to know how each are affected by our choice of filter
scale.  Similar to the previous section, we will use a jackknife test
to estimate the noise, as well as injecting known sources into the
data to observe how they are attenuated.

Maps are produced using the first and second continuous halves of the
data in Fig.~\ref{fig:m17_jk}. This is not an ideal situation, since
the noise properties may evolve with time (e.g., due to changing sky
conditions) leading to a biased estimate of the parent noise
distribution in the complete map from the jackknife. Also, since the
zero-masking depends on the \snr\ of the map, it will be restricted to
regions approximately $\sqrt{2}$ shallower in these maps than for the
full data set. Finally, the cross-linking (positional angles sampled)
is similar, though not identical in the two halves. Ideally one would
have many full maps, as in the case of the Lockman Hole data in the
previous section, from which alternating maps could be combined.

Since our goal in this section is to measure the response of the
map-maker to extended structures, we inject a simulated signal with
power at a range of scales into a relatively empty region of the map.
It is created by drawing a realization of noise within an 800\,arcsec
on-a-side box, with an angular power spectrum $P(k) \propto k^{-3}$
which is appropriate for Galactic cirrus clouds
\citep[e.g.][]{gautier1992}. It is then filtered again with a
14.5\,arcsec Gaussian to model the effect of the \scuba\ optical
response. The RMS of these fluctuations is then normalized to 0.002 pW
so that they are comparable to the dynamic range of M17 itself. The
minimum is then subtracted so that the signal is positive. Finally,
half a period of a (1+cosine)/2 function is used to roll-off the
signal to zero between radii of 300 and 400 arcsec.

The first row of Fig.~\ref{fig:m17_jk} shows the total signal image
averaging the maps made of each independent half of the data, for the
default configuration (inverse-variance weighting has been used). The
columns show reductions using 150, 300, 600, and 900\,arcsec filter
edges in the reductions. For reference, the largest scale that is
completely inscribed by the array footprint is about 400\,arcsec, and
the diagonal of the array is about 600\,arcsec (meaning that scales
beyond 600\,arcsec are completely unconstrained when common-mode
rejection is used).  The synthetic data are clearly seen as the
circular region south of M17. As the filter scale is increased, the
size of the ripples increases accordingly. While larger structures do
seem to appear, negative bowls are a major problem without any other
map constraints.The second row of Fig.~\ref{fig:m17_jk} shows the
jackknife maps. The astronomical emission is almost perfectly removed,
except for a slight impression of M17 near the centre of the map, that
is probably due to some combination of detector gain and pointing
drifts. Otherwise the jackknife appears to be a plausible realization
of noise from the same parent distribution as for the averaged maps.

The third and fourth rows in Fig.~\ref{fig:m17_jk} repeat this
exercise using the bright extended configuration, in which the \snr\
threshold of 5 is again used to constrain the map. As the filter scale
is increased, more of the extended structure in M17 is reproduced in
the map, as evidenced by the blue and red contours (masks generated
from the first and second halves of the data, respectively). The
masking does a generally good job of suppressing the largest-scale
ripples that are produced by the default reduction. However, the noise
away from regions of bright emission does increase noticeably (mottled
appearance). With filter scales $\gsim600$\,arcsec, virtually the
entire region of synthetic emission is correctly identified by the \snr\
mask and allowed to vary freely in the solution.

Next, we analyse the angular power spectra densities (PSDs) of the
maps to understand the signal and noise properties of the map-maker in
the region of synthetic sources, as a function of filter scale. The
left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:m17_def_ps} shows the raw PSDs for the
input synthetic signal (thick black line), the output map signals
(thin solid lines), and the jackknife maps (dashed lines). Colours
encode the filter scales used: 150\,arcsec (red); 300\,arcsec
(orange); 600\,arcsec (green); and 900\,arcsec (blue). Note that, with
the exception of the synthetic data, we only plot the PSDs down to the
second-lowest spatial frequency bin of
$1.875\times10^{-3}$\,arcsec$^{-1}$, or 533\,arcsec, due to the fact
that the smallest is very poorly sampled, and therefore noisy. As the
filter edge is increased, more power is measured in the map PSDs at
larger scales. However, much of this power is clearly produced by
noise which appears in the jackknife PSDs. We estimate the map-maker
transfer function as the ratio between the portion of the signal PSDs
\emph{not} produced by noise, to the input PSD, or
%
\begin{equation}
G(k) = \frac{P_\mathrm{M}(k) - P_\mathrm{JK}(k)}{P_\mathrm{S}(k)},
\end{equation}
%
where $k$ is the spatial frequency, and the subscripts ``M'', ``JK'',
and ``S'' refer to the signal map, jackknife map, and synthetic map,
respectively.

The transfer functions $G(k)$ are plotted as thin solid lines in the
right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:m17_def_ps}. This formula produces
extremely noisy values at large frequencies (small scales), and we
therefore set it to a value of 1 above 0.015\,arcsec$^{-1}$, as well
as any point in the curve where $P_\mathrm{M}(k)$ exceeds
$P_\mathrm{S}(k)$ (i.e. $G(K)$ is assumed to be $\le$1). As expected,
the larger the scale of the filter, the lower the spatial frequency at
which the map transfer function falls. We then correct the map and
jackknife PSDs by dividing by $G(k)$ to produce the thick solid, and
dashed lines in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:m17_def_ps}. This
shows us that, even though the raw noise in the left panel is lower at
small scales when a smaller-scale filter is used (e.g. the red dashed
line), once we correct for the transfer function, we actually win in a
\snr\ sense at large scales using the larger-scale filter, as would be
expected.

These tests are then repeated using the bright extended reduction, in
Fig.~\ref{fig:m17_be_ps}. The most obvious improvement with this
reduction over the default reduction is that the transfer functions
fall more slowly at large angular scales, accompanied by a slower
increase in noise; in other words, there is greatly improved \snr\ at
large angular scales (an obvious conclusion given the appearence of
the maps in Fig.~\ref{fig:m17_jk}). In fact, using the 900\,arcsec
filter edge, the map response is still above 80 per centre right out to
the largest scale accurately measured in the PSDs, 533\,arcsec, which
is about the largest scale that should be recoverable, given the size
of the array footprint and the fact that we use common-mode rejection.
Another interesting feature of these reductions is that the increase
in small-scale noise as the filter edge is increased is not as drastic
as in the default reduction, and the \snr\ improves at scales
$\gsim$60\,arcsec.

One case in which the \snr\ is \emph{worse} using the bright extended
reduction is when using a 150\,arcsec filter. In this case the noise
is considerably larger in the bright extended reduction as evidenced
by the ``kink'' near 150\,arcsec. Referring to the mask contours in
the left panel of the third row, it is clear that the map-maker has
failed to identify much of the bright, extended emission in the region
of the synthetic source. Each area that is not within the contours is
constrained to zero throughout the solution, therefore suppressing
power (and lowering the transfer function), and subsequently reducing
the \snr\ of the final result. This measurement serves as a warning:
the map-maker response is non-linear when using \snr\ masking. Harsh
filtering can provide misleading results as in this example. Maps of
\emph{faint} extended emission will also suffer considerably, as the
structures of interest may not clear the \snr\ threshold for the mask.

Note that alternatives to the zero-masking approach do exist for other
iterative map-makers. For example, \citet{kovacs2008} typically
restricts the solution to a small fixed number of iterations (of order
$\sim$10), although we note that there is no guarantee that maps will
have reasonably converged with such a strategy. For BOLOCAM data of
the Galactic Plane, \citet{aguirre2010} used a Maximum-Entropy
filtering step to suppress large-scales. As in the case of the
\snr-based masking described here, Maximum-Entropy filtering is
non-linear, meaning that it too requires simulations to establish its
transfer function and noise properties as a function of angular scale.

\section{Summary and future work}
\label{sec:summary}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper has described the Submillimetre User Reduction Facility
(SMURF), which was designed to produce maps from the rapidly sampled
$\sim10^4$ bolometers of the \scuba\ instrument. We have presented
sufficient detail in order to be useful not only to users of \scuba,
but for similar detector arrays in the future. The basic elements are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item A simple model which removes most noise in a common-mode
rejection step, along with high-pass filtering, results in maps that
approach the white-noise performance of the detectors.

\item The main problem to overcome with our strategy is the divergence
of the map on large angular scales, due to the degeneracy between the
map, common-mode, and other residual low-frequency noise
contributions. A simple strategy of constraining empty regions of the
map to zero (either a user-supplied mask for known sources, or an
iterative determination of signal above some \snr\ threshold) provides
good constraints for compact objects, and bright/extended structures.

\item For maps of faint point sources, a single (non-iterative)
high-pass filter at the start of the reduction produces maps that are
nearly white-noise limited. We illustatre how to completely whiten the
maps using jackknife measurements of the angular noise power spectrum
in order to reliably extract sources down to the limits of the map.

\item The map-maker has an automatic stopping criterion based on the
change in the map and $\chi^2$ between subsequent iterations, allowing
it to adapt to a wide range of data in a pipeline setting.

\item Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used to identify
correlated noise contributions to \scuba\ data, and it is available as
a generic data cleaning option.

\item The memory requirements and execution times are reasonable
(possible to reduce data in less time than it takes to collect) on
modern high-end desktop computers due to the simplicity of the SMURF
algorithm. It is used in real-time at the telescope for feedback
during observations, and it is also regularly produces nearly
science-grade products at the Canadian Astronomical Data Centre.

\item SMURF is highly configurable, making it easy to vary the order
and types of models that are fit to the data. It is also easy to add
new models to the existing infrastructure.

\item It is believed that a maximum-likelihood map-maker, such as
SANEPIC, will provide improved maps over the iterative algorithm
described here. However, SMURF will most likely be used as an initial
step in such processing since it can quickly clean the bolometer
time-series, as well as perform map-based despiking (a necessarily
iterative step).

\end{enumerate}

%\scuba\ is being re-commissioned. Maybe we will have some initial data
%on fridge performance? If both it, and sky noise are relatively
%well-behaved, might be able to restrict filtering to lower frequencies
%and get larger-scale structures.

%Larger array footprint also helps.

%Talk about potential of Pascale et al. method to get closer to
%max-likelihood map solution (handle maps at constant scan angles with
%weights in Fourier space separately).

\appendix
\section[]{Step correction in detail}
\label{appendix:steps}

An outline of the step correction algorithm is given in
Section~\ref{sec:steps}. This appendix contains a more detailed
description.

Detecting and correcting steps in a single bolometer time stream involves:

\begin{enumerate}

\item locating each candidate step;

\item determining the widths of the candidate steps;

\item determining the height of the step (steps can vary enormously in
height -- for instance the step in the left-hand panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:steps1} is roughly 3\,pW in height, whereas the step at
sample 5100 in the right-hand panel is only 0.01\,pW in height -- the
height of a step is taken as the difference in the local median value
just before and just after the step);

\item correcting all subsequent data values by the step height;

\item once all steps have been corrected, a global offset is added to the
corrected bolometer time stream to ensure that the mean value before and
after step correction is unchanged.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Detecting candidate steps}
The first stage in the algorithm is to search the bolometer time stream for
contiguous blocks of samples that have unusually large mean gradients
compared to the neighbouring samples. Each such block of samples is
considered to be a candidate step. The starting and ending time of each
such block is noted. Once all candidate steps have been found for a
bolometer, the algorithm proceeds to the next stage. Candidate steps are
found as follows.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Smooth the bolometer time stream using a median filter of width
50 samples. This reduces the effects of the noise in the data. Using a
median filter rather than a mean filter helps to preserve the sharp edges
at each step, and is robust against spikes, etc.

The red curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:steps2} shows the median smoothed data for
the right hand bolometer from Fig.~\ref{fig:steps1}.

\item At each time sample, find the difference between the two adjacent
values in the median filtered bolometer data. This is proportional to the
gradient of the median filtered bolometer data. Fig.~\ref{fig:steps3}
shows these differences for the sample bolometer shown in previous
figures. The high gradients at the three step are clearly visible at
indices 5040, 5100 and 5280.

\item Steps are located by looking for difference values that exceed 25
times the RMS value of the nearby neighbouring differences. However, the
local RMS of the differences includes the gradient of the underlying
noise-free time series. So if there is a strong upward or downward trend
in the time series data, the RMS of the difference values will be higher,
potentially resulting in some steps being missed. For instance, at sample
5000 the overall trend in the time series is downwards, resulting in a
negative bias to the difference values.\footnote{This bias is not visible in
Fig.~\ref{fig:steps3} because of the large vertical range, but can be seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:steps4} which has a smaller vertical scale.}

Therefore to enhance the reliability of the step detection, such biases
are removed before locating the steps. To do this, the differences are
smoothed using a mean filter, and the smoothed differences are removed.
The remaining residual difference values represent the gradient due to
steps, spikes, noise, etc. It is important that the smoothed differences
are not polluted by the large values caused by spikes and steps. So
before smoothing, differences of more than three times the RMS difference
(taken over the whole time stream) are identified and flagged. The RMS is
then re-calculated omitting the flagged values and a further two such
rejection iterations are performed. This process flags high gradient values
caused by spikes, jumps, point sources, etc. The difference values close
to a step are often not typical of those in the wider neighbourhood, so
each block of contiguous flagged difference values is doubled in width.
These flagged values are shown as black in Fig.~\ref{fig:steps4}, with
the remaining unflagged values shown in red.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{steps4.pdf}
\caption{The red curve shows the data from Fig.~\ref{fig:steps3} plotted with smaller upper
and lower limits. The blue curve shows the results of smoothing the red
curve. Points omitted from the red curve are shown in black.}
\label{fig:steps4}
\end{figure}

\item The differences for the remaining samples are smoothed
using a mean filter of width 50 samples. The smoothing process fills in small
holes in the array (up to 40 samples), but will not fill in larger holes.
Such larger gaps are filled in later by linear interpolation. The
resulting smoothed differences (shown in blue in Fig.~\ref{fig:steps4})
provide an estimate of the local gradient of the underlying noise-free
median-filtered data stream.

\item The smoothed differences are subtracted from the total differences
to get the residual differences caused by noise, spikes, steps, etc.
These are show in black in Fig.~\ref{fig:steps5}.

\item The local RMS of the residual differences at each time sample is
found by smoothing the squared residual differences using a median filter
of width 200 samples, and then taking the square root of the smoothed values.
These are show in green in Fig.~\ref{fig:steps5}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{steps5.pdf}
\caption{The black curve shows the residuals between the red and blue curves in
Fig.~\ref{fig:steps4}. Missing data is filled in by a combination of
smoothing and linear interpolation. The green curve is the local RMS of the data
over a box width of 200 samples.}
\label{fig:steps5}
\end{figure}

\item Blocks of contiguous samples for which the residual difference
exceeds 25 times the local RMS of the residual differences are
found. Any two such blocks that are separated by fewer than 100
samples are merged into a single block. Blocks are only kept if they
pass all of the following tests:

\begin{enumerate}

\item the width of the block must be less than 200 samples;

\item the total of all the \snr\ values (the absolute residual difference
divided by the local RMS of the residual differences) in the block must be
at least 25;

\item the total of all \snr\ values in the block must exceed half the value of
the largest single \snr\ value in the block.

\end{enumerate}

The second and third tests are intended to prevent spikes being treated as
two very close steps, since such steps will have \snr\ values of opposite
signs and will thus cancel out.

The data in Fig.~\ref{fig:steps5} results in two blocks being defined,
one between samples 5037 and 5102, and another between samples 5286
and 5296. Each of these blocks define the start and end of a candidate
step.  The first block includes two visible steps, but they have been
merged into a single candidate step due to their small separation
(less than 100 samples).

\end{enumerate}
