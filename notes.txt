Directory layout
================

The main paper is in the current directory, and I've added a plots
subdirectory. My thought is that we should store all of the scripts
(IDL, shell scripts + KAPPA whatever) here so that it's relatively
straightforward to re-make plots later, but not all of the raw data.



Analysis and data sets for SMURF paper
======================================

Edit this section to list the raw data that are needed to run the
scripts in the plots subdirectory.
